CORE STATS
==========

    Your Cores are the ranking of your Character's mental and physical attributes.
    They influence every Action your Character takes and helps the GM decide whether
    your Character will succeed or fail Challenges and to what extent. Choose your
    stats wisely, there are plenty of items/environmental hazards that impart a
    "minimum requirement" for a certain Core. 
    
    You can't (or at least shouldn't) be amazing at everything. Often times,
    achieving a higher Core Value means making sacrifices, sometimes that could
    literally be an arm and a leg. 
    
    Below each Stat is described for what it represents. These descriptions are not
    meant to be exhaustive, and with clever role-playing you can 'force' your GM to
    allow you to utilize a Core for something it wouldn't normally be used for.

BRAWN
-----

    Brawn is a measure of your character's physical hardiness, physique and raw
    brute strength. Having a higher Brawn score allows your Character to dish out
    hard punches, take harder hits, and lift heavy burdens. Brawn also determines
    your Accuracy and Damage with Crude Weapons and Unarmed Attacks.

SPEED
-----

    Speed is a measure of how accurately and quickly your Character can move between
    and through obstacles. Having a higher Speed score indicates your character is
    fast moving, acrobatic and in possession of quick reflexes. Speed also
    determines your accuracy with Ranged and Technical weapons.


BRAIN
-----

    Brain is a measure of your character's mental processing power, intuition and
    also precise movements like lock-picking and stitching up wounds. A character
    with a high Brain score can retain more Protocols and are typically in
    possession of a large bank of trivial knowledge. Brain also determines your
    accuracy with Magical and Psionic weapons.

HEART
-----

    Heart is a measure of your character's discipline, will, stubbornness
    and confidence. Your ability to resist and impose mental effects, ignore
    exhaustion and tolerate pain is determined by your Heart Core. It is also
    used in part to determine Sense Challenges involving things like Sight,
    Smell, Taste, Touch, and Feel. 


CORE VALUES
-----------

    Every stat can have a score from -5 to +5 without the help of items, mutations,
    or magic. Every new character a Player creates starts the game with 3 Core
    Points, which may be spread amongst the Core Stats as desired. 
    
    Stats are not locked into their value after they are assigned. There are
    mechanics within the game that allow to both temporarily and permanently
    increase and decrease your Cores.

    A score of 0 for any Core is considered to be the average for an able-bodied
    adult human.
    
    A score of +5 is considered to be on the tamer side of super humanity. Your
    character is not lifting cars one-handed or racing them during their early
    morning jog, but they're definitely well beyond what normal humans are capable
    of.
    
    A score of -5 means that your character is incapacitated in some way. Either
    your character is suffering from a massive injury, is under the effects of a
    potent spell, or otherwise are contending with some environmental effect
    like being shocked by an electric fence. In any event, your character is
    not operating at full capacity if any of their Cores are reduced to -5.
