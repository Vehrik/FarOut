Your Cores are the ranking of your Character's mental and physical attributes.
They influence every Action your Character takes and helps the GM decide whether
your Character will succeed or fail Challenges and to what extent. Choose your
stats wisely, there are plenty of items/environmental hazards that impart a
"minimum requirement" for a certain Core. You can't be amazing at everything
either. Often times, acheiving a higher Core Value means making sacrifices,
sometimes that could literally be an arm and a leg. 

Below each Stat is described for what it represents. These descriptions are not
meant to be exhaustive, and with clever role-playing you can 'force' your GM to
allow you to utilize a Core for something it wouldn't normally be used for.

Stats: Every character has the following Core Stats:

BRAWN
-----
Brawn is a measure of your character's physical hardiness, endurance and raw
brute strength. Having a higher Brawn score allows your Character to dish out
hard punches, take hard blows, and lift heavy objects. Brawn also determines your
Accuracy and Damage with Crude Weapons.

SPEED
-----
Speed is a measure of how accurately and quickly your Character can move between
and through obstacles. Having a higher Speed score indicates your character is
quick moving, acrobatic and in possession of quick reflexes. Speed also
determines your accuracy with Ranged and Technical weapons.

BRAIN
-----
Brain is a measure of your character's mental processing power, intuition and also
precise movements like lock-picking and stitching up wounds. A character with a high
Brain score can retain more Protocols and are typically in possession of a large bank
of trivial knowledge. 
                        
SPIRIT
------
Spirit is a measure of your character's discipline, stubbornness and confidence.
You ability to resist mental effects imposed on them by the environment, ignore
exhaustion and tolerate pain. Spirit also has a minor effect on how well your
Character can integrate with the Mesh.

###CORE VALUES

Every stat can have a score from -5 to +5 without the help of items, mutations, or
magic. Every new character a Player creates starts the game with 3 Core Points, which
may be spread amongst the Core Stats as desired. 

Stats are not locked into their value after they are assigned. There are mechanics
within the game that allow to both temporarily and permanently increase (and
decrease) your Core Stats.

A score of 0 is considered to be the "Average" for an able-bodied adult human.

A score of +5 is considered to be on the tamer side of super humanity. Your character
is not lifting cars one-handed or racing them during their early morning jog, but
they're definitely well beyond what normal humans are capable of. Less Superman and
more Captain America.

A score of -5 means that your character is incapacitated in some way. Either your
character is pinned flat by a boulder, they just inhaled mustard gas or they're
getting tazed with several car batteries, but whatever the case your character's is
not performing any task willingly if any of their Cores are reduced to -5. It only
requires one Core to be dropped to -5 in order to render a Creature Incapacitated and
potentially Helpless.
