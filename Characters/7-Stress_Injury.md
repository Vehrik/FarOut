STRESS

    Heart // Enthralled

       The Character loses their free will, meaning they can't take Actions
       unless they are acting on behalf of another Creature. Reactions may be
       taken as normal. 

       Other Creatures can make 2-worded commands that may or may not be paired
       with a gesture as an Action. The Enthralled Creature fulfills all
       commands given to them in good faith, but Enthralled Creatures cannot be
       made to directly or conspire to harm themselves or their Friends, but
       can't be made to directly or conspire to harm the Creature they're
       Enthralled to or the Friends of the Enthralling Creature. 

       Enthralled Creatures obey the instructions of Friends over those issued
       by Strangers, and obey the instructions of Strangers over those issues by
       Foes. 

       If a Foe issues instructions in the presence of Friends, the Enthralled
       Creature will check for disapproval from their Friends before they carry
       out the instructions. Voicing disapproval costs 1 Action. If no Friend
       voices disapproval, or the Creature doesn't notice the disapproval then
       the Creature follows the command if it satisfies the above criteria. If
       two Friends issue conflicting instructions, the Enthralled Creature
       follows the instructions of the Friend with the highest Heart Core.

       Enthralled Creatures consider other Enthralled Creatures as Strangers. If
       no Friends are present, you treat Foes as if they were Friends.

       Instructions are followed in a FIFO (First In, First Out) pattern.  This
       means that if an Enthralled Creature gets two valid, non-conflicting
       instructions that can't be completed simultaneously, they will fulfill
       the oldest instructions first. Requests can be cancelled by the person
       who issued them, or a Friend that intercepts the Enthralled Creature. If
       you spot an Enthralled Creature, you don't automatically know it's
       Enthralled.

       If the thing that Enthralled a Creature was a Hazard, or some other
       effect such as hunger or thirst, the GM assumes the role as the Foe and
       issues commands on the force's behalf.

Inversely, you can get a Core to be so strong that it becomes Supercharged. This
happens when you accumulate +10 to a single Core. As stated, a Core can't
actually have a value higher than +5, but having a Supercharged Core grant
extremely useful status conditions.

Brawn ++ Hulked Out

    Your Haul sized is doubled for purposes related to storing, plucking and
    Wielding items. Additionally, the worth of each point of Grit you have is
    Doubled while you remain Hulked Out. Objects are considered to have half
    their Momentum for purposes of your Character displacing them.

Speed ++ Fiendish

    All Stride-based movement is treated as Hustling. When you expend Swagger,
    you can Swagger away from 1 additional hazard, and in addition, you treat
    Critical Hits as normal attacks when expending Swagger.

Brain ++ Wide Awake

    All Brain Taps and Checks get an additional +5 bonus, for a wopping +15
    Modifier to all of them. 

Heart ++ Fired Up

    All your Heart Checks against hazards automatically succeed, and any Checks
    against your Heart Taps are made with a Bust. Additionally, the worth of
    each point of Grit you have is Doubled while you remain Fired Up.
