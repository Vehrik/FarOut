Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

HEALTH            
------
Hits: [5] + Brawn + Heart | Defense: Natural Defense [0] + Body Capacity + Level
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Health is comprised of Hits and Defense. Your Character has an amount of Hits
    equal to 5 plus its Brawn and Heart Cores. 
    
    Once you encounter a source of Damage higher than your Defense, it counts as
    a Hit and your Character takes a -1 penalty to a Core of the offender's
    choice. If a character reaches 0 Hits, they are rendered Unconscious. 
    
    Armor, Elixirs and other items within the game can grant Health beyond what is given
    by a Brawn Core. If a Character is reduced to 0 Hits temporarily through damage
    sustained to their Brawn Core, they are Stunned instead of falling Unconscious. If
    they incur even more Damage after falling Unconscious, they begin Flirting With
    Death, the rules of which will be covered later. 
    
    Damage can be categorized as True Damage, meaning that it does not have to
    contend with your Defense at all. This means that 1 point of True Damage
    counts as a single Hit, and the victim immediately incurs the -1 Core
    Penalty. Certain objects, environmental effects, vehicles and very high
    level Spells deal in True Damage.

STRIDE 
------
Natural Stride [3] + Speed 
--------------------------

    Your Character's Stride refers to their ability to move in quick, short sprints while
    in a combat situation without using Equipment, Traits or Maneuvers. This speed is
    independent of the speed they move while adventuring or casually moving through the
    Game World. Stride is determined by adding your Speed score to your Natural Stride (3
    by default). 
    
    If a player is forced to move more than their Stride allows, or they have moved up to
    their normal maximum Stride, but then had their Stride reduced after the fact, they
    Trip in the direction they were moving and if they fail or do not attempt a Recovery,
    begin their next Turn with the Prone status. Movement produced by Equipment, Traits
    or Maneuvers do not count as expended Stride. 
    
    If your Character is relaxed and unguarded, they are considered Flat Footed, and are
    considered to have a Stride equivalent to their Natural Stride.

STAMINA 
-------
0 || 3 + Body Capacity + Soul Capacity
--------------------------------------

    Your Character has a limited number of Challenge they can preform before they
    become utterly exhausted. Whenever your Character attempts a Challenge, the card
    drawn from the Play Deck is placed into your Upper Chakra with its face pointing
    downward. These cards must be exchanged for Stamina in order to be used again.
    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus the value of both
    Capacities, however this value cannot be lower than 0. 
    
    You may either expend 1 point of Stamina or take a -1 penalty to a
    Core in order to move the cards in the Upper Chakra into the Play Deck, then
    shuffle the Play Deck. 
    
    Additionally, you may expend 2 points of Stamina, take a -2 penalty to a Core, or a
    combination of both in order to place the Upper Chakra on the top of your Play Deck,
    then resume play *WITHOUT* shuffling the replenished Play Deck.
    
    You may expend Stamina At Will. This means you can do it during your Turn or
    anyone else's Turn during combat. You may choose to not expend Stamina, even in
    instances where it would lead to death for your Character.
    
    Some items, spells, narrative events, and environmental hazards Exhaust the
    Character. When Exhausted, before the Creature Attempts another CHallenge, all
    Cards that were in the Character's Upper Chakra are placed into the Lower Chakra
    with their face pointing downward. While Exhausted, all discarded Cards go into
    your Lower Chakra.
    
    Cards in the Lower Chakra may be recovered in the same way you may recover cards
    in the Upper Chakra, but their Stamina/Core Penalty cost is doubled. Cards that
    fall into the Lower Chakra remain there until bought back with Stamina.
    
    Stamina is only recovered after a Rest assuming the Character's nutritional needs are
    met. Alternatively, a Character is able to take a Break and recover 13 Cards from the
    Upper Chakra per hour they Break for.

MOMENTUM
--------
[5]
---

    Your Momentum is used to determine the damage you take from Falls, Trips and
    collisions as well as how easy it is to propel your Character by means other than
    Stride. In addition, it is used to determine how hard it is to catch yourself
    mid-fall or Trip. 
    
    Momentum is 5 by default, but has a boundless range. Your Character can lift at
    maximum twice their Momentum plus their Brawn Core. Your own personal Momentum is not
    counted towards this total, but otherwise everything you carry/wear is given a
    Momentum score and the sum of these scores is considered your Burden. 
    
    If your Burden is more than your Character's base Momentum, you Character Busts while
    attempting all Physical Challenges. This is known as Burden I.
    
    If your Burden is higher than your Character's base Momentum in addition to their
    Brawn Score, your Character's Stride is reduced to 1. This is known as
    Burden II 
    
    If your Burden is equal to twice your Character's Momentum Score, your Character's
    Stride is reduced to 0. This is known as Burden III.
