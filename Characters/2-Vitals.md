Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

STRIKES            
-------
[5] + Heart 
-----------

    In a world of plasma rifles, nanobot swarms and rogue A.I.'s, it doesn't
    really matter how much soft, squishy flesh you have wrapped around your
    soft, squishy organs. If you have a 4-inch round hole burned into your neck,
    you're going down, and in the Silk, almost every gun can tear through metal
    like it's paper. Strikes are best thought of equal parts luck and survival
    instinct with anatomy playing in *sometimes*. Every time you lose Strike,
    think of it as a "close call". Whether that's a few singed hairs or a broken
    ankle depends on how many Strikes you have left-over after receiving Damage.

    When initially set, regardless of the Heart Core, a Character cannot be
    created with less than 1 Health.  

    Strikes are also used to Pray, a mechanic that can save you in a
    pinch.

    When you take Damage, you lose an equal amount of Strikes. If a Character is
    reduced to 0 Strikes, they are considered to be Flirting With Death. While a
    Character at 0 Strikes is more than likely in very bad shape, they're still
    able to take Actions/Reactions unless Injuries prevent them from doing so.
    Flirting With Death means that your Character is vulnerable to both KOs and
    Death Blows, which render your Character unconscious and dead respectively.


DODGE
-----
Natural Defense [3] + Speed + Brain
-----------------------------------
    
    When a Creature encounters a source of Damage, if the Difficulty of the
    damage source is less than or equal to the Creature's Dodge it does not
    count as a Hit. Dodge is equivalent to a Creature's Natural Defense (3 by
    default), plus the totals of its Speed and Brain Cores. 

    Once you encounter a source of Damage with a Challenge higher than your
    Creature's Dodge / Dodge Attempt, it counts as a Hit and your Character will
    incur an Injury. How bad the Injury is depends on how many Strikes you have
    remaining.

    A Creature is able to use a Reaction in order to perform an "Active Dodge",
    in which case it makes a Speed Challenge and uses the Attempt Score
    generated in place of its Dodge Vital. 

STAMINA 
-------
3 + BRAWN
---------
    
    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus your Brawn Core.
    Stamina can be negative, which has serious implications on your Character.

    You recover 1 Stamina per hour of Break, and you automatically gain 1 bonus
    Stamina when you finish a Rest. You may not have more than 1 point of bonus
    Stamina at a time. Food and other items supply Stamina upon consumption. You

    Stamina is also used to Grunt, a very powerful mechanic that allows you to
    empower your Actions, or even allow you to retry failed Challenges.

    You may also reduce Damage received by expending Stamina at a 1:1 ratio.
    This means that if you were to take, say, 5 Damage, you can reduce it to 2
    Damage by expending 3 Stamina at the instant you take Damage. When this is
    done, the Damage is treated as if it were its reduced amount for purposes of
    applying Injury. Damage cannot be reduced to less than 1.

    Mutations, Elixirs and other items within the game can grant bonus Stamina
    beyond what is available from a Brawn Core.

    Your Stamina also doubles as a Hunger and Thirst Meter. For every 2 days you
    go without food or 3 hours you go without water (or an equivalent for your
    Creature) you lose 1 point of Stamina. These times are halved if you spend
    more than an hour in a High Stress Scenario in a day. 

    If you Creature has -3 Stamina, they Bust on Move Challenges. If they have
    -4 Stamina, they Bust on ALL actions. If they have -5 Stamina, they fall
    unconscious and continue to lose Stamina. If a Creature reaches -10 Stamina,
    they die.
