Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

HEALTH            
------
1 || [5] + Brawn + Heart  
-------------------------

    Health is comprised of comprised of a number of discrete units known as
    Hits. Your Character has an amount of Health equal to 5 plus its Brawn and
    Heart. When initially set, regardless of the Brawn or Heart Cores, a
    Character cannot be created with less than 1 Health.  
    
    Once you encounter a source of Damage higher than your Creature's Defense,
    it counts as a Hit and your Character takes a -1 penalty to a Core of the
    offender's choice, though this does not in turn reduce the Viitals
    associated with the penalized Core. 
    
    Mutations, Elixirs and other items within the game can grant Health beyond
    what is given by Brawn and Heart Cores. 

    If a Character is reduced to 0 Health, they are considered to be Flirting
    With Death. Characters that are Flirting With Death are unable to act
    willingly, meaning they cannot make Action or Reactions. The mechanics
    associated with Death and Dying will be explained in detail in the Combat
    section of this document.

DEFENSE
-------
Natural Defense [1] + Brawn + Speed
-----------------------------------
    
    Health is closely tied with Defense. When a Creature encounters a source of
    Damage, if the Damage value is less than or equal to the Creature's Defense,
    it does not count as a Hit. 

    Natural Defense cannot be higher than +10.

    Damage can be categorized as True Damage, meaning that it does not have to
    contend with your Defense at all. This means that 1 point of True Damage
    counts as a single Hit, and the victim immediately incurs the -1 Core
    Penalty. Certain objects, environmental effects, vehicles and very high
    level Spells deal in True Damage.

STRIDE 
------
1 || Natural Stride [3] + Speed 
-------------------------------

    Your Character's Stride refers to their ability to move in quick, short sprints while
    in a combat situation without using Equipment, Traits or Maneuvers. This speed is
    independent of the speed they move while adventuring or casually moving through the
    Game World. Stride is determined by adding your Speed score to your Natural Stride (3
    by default). 
    
    If a player is forced to move more than their Stride allows, but then had
    they Trip in the direction they were moving and if they fail or do not
    attempt a Recovery, begin their next Turn with the Prone status. Movement
    produced by Equipment, Traits or Maneuvers do not count as expended Stride. 
    
    If your Character is relaxed and unguarded, they are considered Flat Footed, and are
    considered to have a Stride equivalent to their Natural Stride.

STAMINA 
-------
0 || 3 + Heart
--------------

    Your Character has a limited number of Challenge they can preform before
    they become utterly exhausted. FarOut utilizes a Chakra system to
    simulate exhaustion in Creatures, and it revolves around your Stamina
    points. Additionally, utilizing Magic requires the use of Stamina. It needs
    to be used wisely, as you can end up in situations where your Character,
    while otherwise perfectly healthy, collapses to the floor unable to move!

    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus your Heart Core,
    however this value cannot be lower than 0 in the event that your Heart Core
    has a negative value. 

MOMENTUM
--------
[5]
---

    Your Momentum is used to determine the damage you take from Falls, Trips and
    collisions as well as how easy it is to propel your Character by means other than
    Stride. In addition, it is used to determine how hard it is to catch yourself
    mid-fall or Trip. 
    
    Momentum is 5 by default, but has a boundless range. Your Character can lift at
    maximum twice their Momentum plus their Brawn Core. Your own personal Momentum is not
    counted towards this total, but otherwise everything you carry/wear is given a
    Momentum score and the sum of these scores is considered your Burden. 
    
    If your Burden is more than your Character's base Momentum, you Character Busts while
    attempting all Physical Challenges. This is known as Burden I.
    
    If your Burden is higher than your Character's base Momentum in addition to
    their Brawn Score, your Character's Stride is reduced to 1 and they may only
    make one Action per round of Combat. This is known as Burden II. 
    
    If your Burden is equal to twice your Character's Momentum Score, your
    Character's Stride is reduced to 0 and may not preform any other Actions
    than Deburdening. This is known as Burden III.
