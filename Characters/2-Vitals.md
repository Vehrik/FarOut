Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

HEALTH            
------
1 || [5] + Brawn + Heart  
------------------------

    Health is of comprised of a number of discrete units known as Hits. Your
    Character has an amount of Health equal to 5 plus its Brawn and Heart Cores.
    When initially set, regardless of the Brawn or Heart Cores, a Character
    cannot be created with less than 1 Health.  
    
    Once you encounter a source of Damage higher than your Creature's Defense,
    it counts as a Hit and your Character will incur an Injury.

    If a Character is reduced to 0 Health, they are considered to be Flirting
    With Death. Characters that are Flirting With Death are unable to act
    willingly, meaning they cannot make Action or Reactions. The mechanics
    associated with Death and Dying will be explained in detail in the Combat
    section of this document.

    Mutations, Elixirs and other items within the game can grant Health beyond
    what is given by Brawn and Heart Cores. 


DEFENSE
-------
0 || Natural Defense [1] + Speed + Brain
----------------------------------------
    
    Health is closely tied with Defense. When a Creature encounters a source of
    Damage, if the Damage value is less than or equal to the Creature's Defense,
    it does not count as a Hit. Defense is equivalent to a Creature's Natural
    Defense (1 by default), plus the totals of its Speed and Brain Cores. A
    Creature's Defense cannot be lower than 0.

    When determining Injury, you must consider by how much a Creature's Defense was
    overcome. Typically, if a Creature's defense was beat by a few points, a body
    part will be Damaged, if the Defense was beaten twice over (i.e. the damage
    was equal to 2x the Creature's Defense or slightly higher) a body part will
    be Disabled, and if the Defense was beaten thrice over a body part will be
    Destroyed.

    Damage can be categorized as True Damage, meaning that it does not have to
    contend with your Defense at all. This means that 1 point of True Damage
    counts as a single Hit, and the victim immediately incurs incurs Injury.
    Certain objects, environmental effects, vehicles and very high level Spells
    deal in True Damage.

STRIDE 
------
1 || Natural Stride [3] + Speed 
-------------------------------

    Your Character's Stride refers to their ability to move in quick, short
    sprints while in a combat situation without using Equipment, Traits or
    Maneuvers. This speed is independent of the speed they move while
    adventuring or casually moving through the Game World. Stride is determined
    by adding your Speed score to your Natural Stride (3 by default). 
    
    If a player is forced to move more than their Stride allows, they Trip in
    the direction they were moving and if they fail or do not attempt a
    Recovery, begin their next Turn with the Prone status. Movement produced by
    Equipment, Traits or Maneuvers do not count as Stride. 
    
    If your Character is relaxed and unguarded, they are considered Flat Footed,
    and are considered to have a Stride equivalent to their Natural Stride.

STAMINA 
-------
0 || 3 + Heart
--------------

    Your Character has a limited number of Challenge they can perform before
    they become utterly exhausted. FarOut utilizes a Chakra system to simulate
    exhaustion in Creatures, and it revolves around your Stamina points.
    Additionally, utilizing Magic requires the use of Stamina. It needs to be
    used wisely, as you can end up in situations where your Character, while
    otherwise perfectly healthy, collapses to the floor unable to move!

    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus your Heart Core,
    however this value cannot be lower than 0 in the event that your Heart Core
    total has a negative value. 

MOMENTUM
--------
5 + Brawn
---------

    Your Momentum is used to determine the damage you take from Falls, Trips and
    collisions as well as how easy it is to propel your Character by means other
    than Stride. In addition, it is used to determine how hard it is to catch
    yourself mid-fall or Trip. 
    
    Momentum is 5 by default, but has a boundless range. Your Character can lift
    at maximum twice their Momentum plus their Brawn Core. Your own personal
    Momentum is not counted towards this total, but otherwise everything you
    carry/wear is given a Momentum score and the sum of these scores is
    considered your Burden. 
    
    If your Burden is more than your Character's Momentum, you Character Busts
    while attempting all Physical Challenges. This is known as Burden I.
    
    If your Burden is higher than your Character's base Momentum but lower than
    double their Momentum, your Character's Stride is reduced to 1 and they may
    only make one Action per round of Combat. This is known as Burden II. 
    
    If your Burden is equal to twice your Character's Momentum Score, your
    Character's Stride is reduced to 0 and may not preform any other Actions
    than Deburdening. This is known as Burden III.

    Attempting to lift a Burden that is higher than your Momentum is
    automatically failed, but one should keep in mind that the Momentum of
    something can be reduced/increased without adding or removing mass from the
    Burden. Things like balance, friction and gravity result a Momentum being
    prone to change.
