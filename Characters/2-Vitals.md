Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

HEALTH            
------
1 || [5] + Brawn 
----------------

    Health is is a measure of how much physical damage your Character can
    sustain before they lose consciousness. Your Character has an amount of
    Health equal to 5 plus its Brawn and Heart Cores. When initially set,
    regardless of the Brawn or Heart Cores, a Character cannot be created with
    less than 1 Health.  

    If a Character is reduced to 0 Health, they are considered to be Flirting
    With Death. Characters that are Flirting With Death are unable to act
    willingly, meaning they cannot make Actions or Reactions. The mechanics
    associated with Death and Dying will be explained in detail in the Combat
    section of this document.

    Mutations, Elixirs and other items within the game can grant Health beyond
    what is given by Brawn and Heart Cores. 


DODGE
-----
0 || Natural Defense [5] + Speed + Brain
----------------------------------------
    
    When a Creature encounters a source of Damage, if the Difficulty of the
    damage source is less than or equal to the Creature's Dodge it does not
    count as a Hit. Dodge is equivalent to a Creature's Natural Defense (1 by
    default), plus the totals of its Speed and Brain Cores. A Creature's Dodge
    cannot be lower than 0.

    Once you encounter a source of Damage with a Challenge higher than your
    Creature's Dodge / Dodge Attempt, it counts as a Hit and your Character will
    incur an Injury if their Health drops below certain thresholds. 

    A Creature is able to use a Reaction in order to perform an "Active Dodge",
    in which case it makes a Speed Challenge and uses the Attempt Score
    generated in place of its Dodge Vital. 

STAMINA 
-------
0 || 3 + Heart
--------------
    
    There are certain status effects in the game that incur Exhaustion.
    Exhaustion 
    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus your Heart Core,
    however this value cannot be lower than 0 in the event that your Heart Core
    has a negative value.
