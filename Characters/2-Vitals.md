Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

STRIKES            
-------
[5] + Heart 
-----------

    In a world of plasma rifles, nanobot swarms and rogue A.I.'s, it doesn't
    really matter how much soft, squishy flesh you have wrapped around your
    soft, squishy organs. If you have a 4-inch round hole burned into your neck,
    you're going down, and in the Silk, almost every gun can tear through metal
    like it's paper.

    Strikes are best thought of equal parts luck and survival instinct with
    anatomy playing in *sometimes*. Every time you lose Strike, think of it as a
    "close call". Whether that's a few singed hairs or a broken ankle depends on
    how many Strikes you have left-over after receiving Damage.

    When initially set, regardless of the Heart Core, a Character cannot be
    created with less than 1 Health.  

    Strikes are also used to Pray, a mechanic that can save you in a
    pinch.

    When you take Damage, you lose an equal amount of Strikes. If a Character is
    reduced to 0 Strikes, they are considered to be Flirting With Death. While a
    Character at 0 Strikes is more than likely in very bad shape, they're still
    able to take Actions/Reactions unless Injuries prevent them from doing so.
    Flirting With Death means that your Character is Vulnerable, which can lead
    to them being Knocked Out or Executed.

DODGE
-----
Natural Defense [3] + Speed + Brain
-----------------------------------
    
    When a Creature encounters a source of Damage from a hostile Creature, if
    the Difficulty of the Attack is less than or equal to the Creature's Dodge
    it does not count as a Hit. Dodge is equivalent to a Creature's Natural
    Defense (3 by default), plus the totals of its Speed and Brain Cores. 

    Once you encounter a source of Damage with a Challenge higher than your
    Creature's Dodge, it counts as a Hit and your Character will incur an
    Injury. How bad the Injury is depends on how many Strikes you have remaining
    after you account for the Damage just received.

STAMINA 
-------
5 + BRAWN
---------
    
    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus your Brawn Core.
    Stamina cannot be negative, but sitting at 0 Stamina is still dangerous.

    Stamina has a wide variety of uses. Among other things, Stamina can be used
    to retry failed Challenges, nullify the effects of being Staggered, move
    quickly, interrupt enemy Actions and reduce Damage.

    You recover Stamina by Taking A Break and Patching Up. Mutations, Elixirs
    and other items within the game can grant bonus Stamina beyond what is
    available from a Brawn Core.

    There are many hazards in the game that cause Stamina Damage. Stamina Damage
    is a direct penalty Stamina equivalent to the value of the Stamina Damage.
    That is, if you take 3 Stamina Damage, you lose 3 Stamina that may be
    recovered as normal. If you reach 0 Stamina and incur Stamina Damage, every
    2 points of Stamina Damage is converted to 1 Stress.
