Every Character has the following Vitals, which are derived from the Core Stats:

STRIKES            
-------
[5] + Heart 
-----------

    In a world of plasma rifles, nanobot swarms and rogue A.I.'s, it doesn't
    really matter how much soft, squishy flesh you have wrapped around your
    soft, squishy organs. If you have a 4-inch round hole burned into your neck,
    you're going down, and in the Silk, almost every gun can tear through metal
    like it's paper.

    Strikes are best thought of equal parts luck and survival instinct with
    anatomy playing in *sometimes*. Every time you lose Strike, think of it as a
    "close call". Whether that's a few singed hairs or a broken ankle depends on
    how many Strikes you have left-over after receiving Damage.

    When initially set, regardless of the Heart Core, a Character cannot be
    created with less than 1 Health.  

    Strikes are also used to Pray, a mechanic that can save you in a pinch.

    When you take Damage, you lose an equal amount of Strikes. If a Character is
    reduced to 0 Strikes, they are considered to be Flirting With Death. While a
    Character at 0 Strikes is more than likely in very bad shape, they're still
    able to take Actions/Reactions unless Injuries prevent them from doing so.
    Flirting With Death means that your Character is Vulnerable, which can lead
    to them being Knocked Out or Executed.

DEFENSE
-------
3 + SPEED + BRAIN
-----------------
    
    When a Creature encounters a source of Damage from a hostile Creature, if
    the Difficulty of the Attack's Challenge is less than or equal to the
    Creature's Defense it does not count as a Hit. Defense is 3 by default but
    can be raised with Mutations and items.

    Once you encounter a source of Damage with a Difficulty higher than your
    Creature's Dodge, it counts as a Hit and your Character will incur an
    Injury. How bad the Injury is depends on how many Strikes you have remaining
    after you account for the Damage just received.

    Defense cannot be higher than 15. Damage that has Penetration ignore
    Defense lower than their Penetration level.

STAMINA 
-------
5 + BRAWN + HEART
-----------------
    
    You have a number of Stamina points equivalent to 3 plus your Brawn and
    Heart Cores.  Stamina cannot be negative, but sitting at 0 Stamina is still
    dangerous.

    Stamina has a wide variety of uses. Among other things, Stamina can be used
    to retry failed Challenges, nullify the effects of being Staggered, move
    quickly, interrupt enemy Actions and reduce Damage.

    You recover Stamina by Taking A Break and Patching Up. Mutations, Elixirs
    and other items within the game can grant bonus Stamina beyond what is
    available from a Brawn Core.

    There are many hazards in the game that cause Stamina Damage. Stamina Damage
    is a direct penalty Stamina equivalent to the value of the Stamina Damage.
    That is, if you take 3 Stamina Damage, you lose 3 Stamina that may be
    recovered as normal. If you reach 0 Stamina and incur Stamina Damage, every
    2 points of Stamina Damage is converted to 1 Stress.

DASH
----
5ft x SPEED
-----------

    In High Stress Scenarios, your Character can only move specific distances as
    dictated by their Move Action. In addition to this Movement, the Character
    can Dash a fixed distance for free every Round.

    Dash movement is important because it allows you to bypass Obstacles without
    having to Attempt a Challenge assuming the obstacle is something that can be
    Challenged with your Speed Core.

    It is also used when you Dodge in order to determine whether or not you are
    able to exit the Area of something.

SKILL
-----
3 + BRAIN
---------


MOMENTUM
--------
5 + BRAWN
---------
