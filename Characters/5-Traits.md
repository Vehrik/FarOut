MUTATIONS 
=========

    At Character Creation you are given 3 Splice Points points, however,
    applying them to your Character is optional. You may defer their application
    to a later time, or decide not to use them at all. You may also exchange 2
    Splice Points for 1 Slant.
    
    At Level 1, you may optionally exchange 1 Slant in order to gain 2 Splice
    Points. You may make this exchange up to 3 times during Character creation.
    After this, you must have the appropriate amount of Prestige and Credit in
    order to gain additional Splice Points points in the form of Items,
    Equipment and Mutations.
    
    Splice Points may be exchanged for anything from to fangs, to AI-designed
    martial arts, to acid breath, to wrist mounted laser cannons.
    
    Whatever your Mutation is, it represents a change to your character's
    appearance that is either mechanical, technological or biological that
    warrants the effect it grants you.
   
    If your character able to reach out and touch someone 30ft away, for
    example, it means something along the lines of your character is able to
    shoot web, it has a tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted harpoon
    launcher. The exact description of a Mutation depends on the Character's
    back-story, the function of the Mutation and the narrative context of the
    game you are playing.

    Your Mutation is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties
    inform the Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Mutations
    won't be able to influence creature statistics like Strikes, Stamina, and
    Threat more than is defined by their Properties, but the resulting
    Aesthetics may allow for creative applications or unforeseen consequences
    within the Narrative.  For example, having fangs would make intimidating
    people slightly easier, but would make comforting a distressed child harder.
    Oozing acid would be a great way to make people respect your personal space,
    but makes finding a restaurant that's willing to seat you almost impossible.

    Whatever your Mutation ends up being you must decide on the following three
    details:

            1. The location of the Mutation. You may designate the Mutation as
               being anchored to, projected from or embedded in either your
               Torso, Head, or one of your Limbs. 

               Multiple Mutations may be anchored to/embedded in the same
               portion of your body. Mutations may become less effective or even
               unuseable if the body part the Mutation is associated with
               becomes Injured or Disabled. 

               You may expend 1 Splice Point in order to distribute a Mutations
               across one additional limb, and in this case, both body sections
               must be Injured before it effects the Mutation's effectiveness.

               If the limb you place the Mutation on also houses a Hand (by
               default this is your arms), the Mutation will consume the Hand
               unless you expend 1 additional Splice Point in order to conserve
               the Hand. 

               You may optionally designate the Mutation as a Crux, giving you 3
               additional Splice Points points to use on the Mutation designated
               as a Crux, but if the Crux is damaged, it could Fail
               Catastrophically. The more potent the Crux, the more dangerous it
               becomes for its user.

            2. The material the Mutation is made of. A Mutation may be comprised
               of either Metal, Biomass or Energy or some combination thereof.
               It will influence to what degree certain hazards will effect your
               Character. Each category of material will also incur one of the
               following bonuses based on which material the Mutation is
               *mostly* comprised of:
                    
                        Metal - You gain +2 point of Natural Defense and the
                        limb automatically qualifies as a Crude Weapon with a
                        Damage of 2 and a Range of 0. You may expand upon this
                        Damage if you make the Mutation Crude as well, but you
                        may also create a Technical Mutation and have it double
                        as a improvised Crude Weapon. 

                        Biomass - As long as the Mutation is not a Crux, the
                        Player may choose to have the Mutation Concealed with no
                        additional Splice Point Cost. Damaged Mutations may be
                        forced to work as normal by expending 1 Stamina for a
                        single use. You may also expend 2 Stamina in order to
                        force a Disabled Biomass Mutation to work for a single
                        use as if it were merely Malfunctioning.

                        Energy - The Mutation gains a Range of 20ft, 1 Point of
                        Damage and 5ft of Area for no additional cost. 

            3. The general dimensions of the Mutation. You don't need to have
               the measurements down to the inch, but you need a solid concept
               of whether the shoulder mounted flamethrower means you're adding
               3 seperate wine-bottle sized cynlinders onto your upper arm, or
               if you're carrying what amounts to a back-pack filled with jet
               fuel on your back. 

               This mass isn't anymore vulnerable than any other part of the
               body unless the Mutation is also a Crux, in which case you need
               to carefully considered how to distribute the mass of your
               Mutation. While not meant to be exact, the general guideline for
               a Splice Points to Volume relationship is 1 litre of distilled
               water to 1 Splice Point spent. 


STEP 1) HOW MANY MUTATIONS? 
========================

    Whether or not you take a Mutation at all should be carefully considered.
    While they are undoubtedly useful, Mutations incur a financial and practical
    consideration for you Character. 
    
    The bodies of Creatures can only handle so much Mutation before it starts to
    stress existing body systems. At level 1, for every 4 Splice Points used,
    their Character's Stamina decreases by 2. 

    Beyond the intial Splice Points bought at Character Creation, you can
    purchase specific Mutations/ Every 3 Splice Point spent adds 1 point of
    Burden to your Character. As a default, you are able to gather and utilize
    as much as 24 Splice Points, but your GM may lower or raise this number
    depending on what type of game they are running.
    
    You may have more than one Mutation at once.

STEP 2) WHAT PROPERTIES WILL THE MUTATION(S) HAVE?
==================================================

There are two types of Mutations, Natural Weapons and Anatomy Mutations.

NATURAL WEAPONS
---------------

### DAMAGE(D)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points / 1 D
    
    This value is used to determine the Damage dealt by this Mutation OR its
    products whenever it contacts a Creature. This Damage may either be Force,
    Fire, Frost, Poison, or Electric Damage. 

    Any Mutation that has Range is automatically a Technical weapon and thus
    must use Speed or Brain for its Attacks. Otherwise you may specify whether
    it uses Heart or Brawn for its Attacks.

### RANGE (R)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 20ft

    This value determines how far away your Mutation's missiles are able to
    feasibly apply the Mutation's other properties. This is seperate from
    determining if you actually hit your Target, this value is used to determine
    if you can even try. 

    If you do not purchase Volume or Integrity for a Mutation that has Range, it
    implies that the Mutation does not produce a projectile, but rather that you
    are flinging out a limb (or pseduolimb) that is vunerable to Quick Attacks
    all along the length of its Range. Pseudolimbs has roughly the same diameter
    as the rest of the Character's limbs. This enables you to utilize the
    Mutation without having to keep track of how much material your Creature is
    still able to output.

    Mutated limbs that also house a Hand can combine their properties with melee
    weapons into a single attack. 

### AREA (A)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 12ft of Area.

    The Trait's Area refers to how much space the Trait's products effects when
    the Trait is activated. It may be combined with Range in order to be
    projected away from your Character. 

    When you purchase Area, each dimension (length/width/height) must be given
    at-least 1ft. It doesn't need to actually fill the entire space of its Area,
    but for purposes related determining if it touches a Creature, it will be
    treated as if it has the dimensions equivalent to its Area.

    The Area of a Trait also acts as an ammo counter. You can only produce so
    much material before your body needs to take time to replenish its stores.
    The smallest amount of Area a projectile can take up is 3, making its Area
    1x1x1ft. This means that you can produce up to 4 projectiles per 12ft of
    Area bought.

    You replenish (3 + Brawn)ft of Area per hour assuming you have at least 1 Stamina.
    Each hour of Break restores 12ft of Area, regardless of their Stamina.

### STRESS
#### COST: 3 Splice Points per 1 point of Stress
    
    This value is used to determine the penalty applied to a Capacity of a
    target Creature once it comes in contact with the Mutation/its products.

    Stress must be accompanied by Damage or Integrity. Stress lasts until the
    end of the round in which it was applied, but can be immediately reapplied
    at the beginning of the next round if the victim is still in contact with
    the source of the Stress.

    An afflicted Creature may not necessarily be aware they are affected by
    Stress until they actually use a Core if the Mutation does not also cause
    Damage, unless the Player inflicting Stress has decided they have wanted it
    to cause sensory effects at all times.

    You must designate whether the Stress your Trait applies is Mental or
    Physical. If a Creature remains in contact with a Trait/its products, for
    multiple rounds the Stress accumulates up to double the amount of Stress
    that the Trait possesses.


### INTEGRITY
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 3 Integrity
    
    Mutation Integrity implies that it produces tangible material that persists
    in the Game World until it is destroyed/dispersed by oppossing forces. You
    must designate the product as either gas, liquid, or solid. A Mutation's
    products may be used as Simple Tools to help complete a Challenge. 

    All properties of a Natural Weapon (Damage, Stress, Boost, Effect
    Challenege) will be reapplied to the anything touching the Trait's Area at
    the beginning of every Round until the Trait's products are reduced to an
    Integrity of 0. 

    The owner has implied immunity to the Mutation's hazardous properties, but
    they may waive this immunity to grant the Mutation 1 additional point of
    Damage.
     
    The Integrity of a Mutation's products are reduced by 1 whenever they are
    Challenged or used to complete a Challenge. They are destroyed immediately
    if they encounter a Challenge that is 5 or more points higher than their
    Integrity. If Damage is applied to something with Integrity, the Damage is
    treated as if it were an Attempt Score in a Challenge against the material.
    The GM will determine if the Integrity fails before they reduce it by 1.

    Integrity implicitely grants the products of a Mutation Momentum equivalent
    to the Integrity / 3 (rounded down). If the products are gaseous, the Momentum
    is capped at 0. Reducing Intergrity reduces the Momentum of the generated
    product.

    If the Mutation is reapplied to space occupied by its products before their
    Integrity is depleted, the Integrity is compounded up to a maximum value of
    15. 

    Mutations with Integrity may be set as traps in ways that make sense for its
    given Form. Traps laid in this way have a Detection Challenge equivalent to
    the Set Trap Challenge Attempted by the trapper.


### BOOST
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1 Boost

    Boost is a direct bonus added to a Creature's designated Core. Core Boost
    cannot raise a single Core to a total higher than 5.

    After Boost is removed from a Creature, the Capacities of the Boosted Cores
    accumulate an amount of Stress equivalent to half the amount of Boost
    received rounded down. This Stress can be cleansed with 2 Stamina, or by
    taking a Break.

    The products of a Trait may be imbued with Boost in order to give them
    Effects. This Effect is a pre-defined Action that a Creature would normally
    be able to complete empty handed or with a Simple Tool. Effects use their
    creator's Play Deck and the Boost supplied in order to generate a
    Difficulty. Effects apply whenever the contact something for the first time
    in a round.

    Products imbued with Brawn are treated as if they have a Momentum equivalent
    with the amount of Brawn Boost it has for purposes of determining how much
    Burden it can handle. This is seperate from their actual Momentum, which is
    linked to their Integrity.

    Boost can be used in tandem with Telepathic Links and Integrity in order to
    develop Constructs. Constructs are friendly pseudo-Creatures that assume any
    Boost given to them as Cores that are utilized identically to the way they
    are used for Player Characters.

    Constructs can have Empty Cores, meaning that they automatically fail any
    Challenges that test these Empty Cores. Empty Cores don't cause the
    Construct to accumulate the penalties associated with having a low Core, but
    otherwise react to Stress as Normal. Stressing an Empty Core is dealt as
    Damage to the Construct's Integrity instead.

    Constructs are able to Double and Triple Down if they have no Empty Cores.

### CONCEALMENT (~)
#### COST: 1 Splice Point
    
    A Mutation with this property is not discernible at a glance. In order to
    discover a Concealed Mutation, a Creature must either have a specialized
    tool that explicitly detects the material the Concealed Mutation is made of,
    or otherwise the inspecting Creature is able to freely touch and grope the
    Creature, as if frisking them. This protects the Mutation from detection if
    neither of the above criteria are met. Activating the Mutation makes it
    vulnerable to analysis, and Creatures who saw the Mutation activated do not
    forget that you have it.

    If one has multiple Mutations, Concealment must be purchased for each
    seperate Mutation. While the Mutation is being activated/used, it loses the
    benefit of Concealment. Purchasing Concealment twice makes the Mutation
    completely inperceivable by the naked eye. A DNA Analysis would need to be
    performed to determine the existence the of the Mutation without otherwise
    having seen it being used.

    The Cost of concealing a Crux is double unless the Mutation is made of
    mostly Biomass.

### TELEPATHIC LINK (T)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points

    Typically, products of a Mutation are mindless objects. You may give your
    Mutation a Telepathic Link.

    A Telepathic Link allows you sense the position of any intact products
    created by the Mutation.

    Telepathic Links have a range of 100ft, but this range may be doubled for 1
    Splice Point per doubling. If the range of a Telepathic Link is exceeded, it
    breaks, but automatically reconnects if the Mutation and its owner get
    within the link's max range after decoupling.

### STAMINA REPLENISHMENT (SR)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points / 1 SR
    
    This value represents how much Stamina of a Target may be replenished if the
    Effect of the Mutation is applied. 

    If a Character has Injuries II and Injury I, receiving Stamina Replenishment
    either partially or completely removes them, and the Stress associated with
    them. An Injury II requires 2 SR to be completely healed, but can be
    downgraded to a Injury I with 1 SR. Likewise, a Injury I is completely
    healed with 1 SR. Injuries are healed in the order that the Healer chooses.

    Injuries will be healed before a Creature's Stamina is replenished.
 
    Buying SR implies you are adding to a SR Pool with which you may dole out at
    your discretion. 1 Point of SR is replenished per hour of Break Time
    assuming that a Creature has met its nutritional requirements. 

ANATOMY MUTATIONS
-----------------

### BONUS NATURAL DEFENSE
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1.5 Bonus Natural Defense 

    You Creature's Natural Dodge Attempts are increased by the amount of Bonus
    Dodge a Mutation has. Other effects of increased Natural Defense (higher
    Fall Damage and stronger Unarmed Strikes) also apply. 

    Bonus Natural Defense is rounded down to to the nearest natural number when
    determining the total when you are avoiding attacks.

### BONUS STAMINA
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1 Bonus Stamina.

    Your Creature's Stamina is increased by 1 per point of Bonus Stamina
    purchased. Do keep in mind the Stamina penalty associated with using a high
    amount of Splice Points.    

### BONUS HANDS
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per Hand 
    
    Typically Creatures have two "hands" that they can wield items with in a
    High Stress Scenario. Gaining an extra Hand allows you to simultaneously
    wield 3 1-Handed Weapons at a time, or some combination of 2-Handed Weapons
    and 1-Handed Weapons. 

    Gaining more than 1 Hand allows for a larger variety of weapon combinations.
    Despite there name, Hands do not have to be actual hands. Like all
    Mutations, the details of their aesthetics is between you and your
    table-mates. As always, the Creature needs to account for the Momentum of
    the Weapons he is holding with any Hand.

    Purchased Hands may be placed on any limb, generate another limb that's the
    same size as the Creature's other limbs, or be placed on a pseudo-limb
    generated by a seperate Mutation.

    If placed on a pre-existing mutation, by default the Trait can't add its
    properties to those supplied by the item held in it, but you may expend 2
    additional Splice Point in order to make the Hand Synergizing, meaning that
    you can combine the properties of the Trait with properties of the item held
    in the Synergizing Hand. This may force you to make aesthetic adjustments to
    your Trait.

    All Creatures are considered ambidextrous for all Challenges.

### SENSE ENHANCEMENT
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 3 Sense Points

    You are able to enhance your Senses with either direct Attempt Bonuses, or
    unique sight enhancments that broaden the spectrum of what and how your
    Character can perceive the Game World.

    This system is described within the Physiology section of this book. Amongst
    other things, you can gain the ability to see in the dark, or sense the
    heart beats of other Creatures.

### RESIZE
#### COST: 3 Splice Points per Size Category  
    
    There are 3 Size Categories that Player Characters can be created under.
    From smallest to largest they are:

         Small 
         Medium
         Big     

    Each size has various properties that alter your Character's baseline
    physiology. These alternations are not all beneficial. Each Size Category is
    explained in detail in the Physiology section.

DAMAGED MUTATIONS 
=================

Mutations aren't just balls of numbers that you tap your finger on to make the
bad guys go away. They're relics of your Characters story AND features on your
Character's anatomy. A Character more than likely sees there Mutation as a part
of their body or at least as a important item that deserves respect. Regardless,
you will more than likely damage your Mutation.

Mutations have a chance to become Damaged whenever the limb their attached
to/housed within become Damaged. It depends on how hard the hit was, but a
Damaged Mutation can be either Malfunctioning or Disabled.

Using a Malfunctioning Mutation incurs a Bust whenever you are using it. A
Disabled Mutation cannot be used at all.

Crux can Catastrophically Fail if they become Damaged. When a Crux
Catastrophically Fails, it imparts all its negative effects on its owner as if
it was activated with an Attempt of 15. The owner automatically fails any
Challenges applied to them due to a Catastrophically Failing Crux.

If the Mutation is a Anatomy Mutation, half of all of the Splice Points placed
into it are treated as Damage that applies to its owner.

Boost is treated as Stress in these instances. If the Mutation has Range or
Area, the GM has free reign to direct the Mutation's involuntary activation as
they see fit.
