FOOD, FRIENDS, & FATIGUE
========================

Technology has come a long way, but humans haven't figured out how to produce
energy from nothing. You need to eat, and you need to replenish bodily
resources. Even if you're a robot, you need to run maintenance on your body and
replenish materials from time to time to keep your body in good repair.

Food is any resource that a Character can consume in order to replenish Stamina.
Food doesn't look the same for everybody, but anything that is categorized as
food has the following Properties:

        Satiation

            This refers to the nutritional benefit of both the solid and liquid
            materials that your Character can consume in order to replenish
            Stamina. It has a value between -5 to +5.

            A value of 5 indicates it's luxuriously delicious food that is
            nutritionally complete and will leave your Character full and in
            good spirits. It replenished +5 Stamina 

            A value of -5 indicates the food was actually incredibly dangerous
            to eat. Your Character probably only ate it because they haven't
            eaten in a week and they didn't care that the apple was half rotten,
            half hairy. It strips 5 Stamina from your Character.

            Your Creature must take in 3 Satiation worth of food every day, plus
            one more per hour they spend in High Stress Scenario's.

        Quality
           
            If a meal has a quality of 5 or higher, then it grants your
            Character a bonus point of Stamina. There are many factors that
            determine the quality of the meal, and sometimes the food/drink
            itself is amazing enough to make it a Quality 5 Meal. However, even
            expired NutroBars can be turned into a Quality 4 Meal if the
            Characters enhance the some of the following aspects of the Meal:

                1. Ambience (-3<->+3)
                    
                    This refers to the aesthetic qualities of where you're
                    eating. It is increased by taking time out to clean your
                    eating area, decoratively plating food, and providing
                    entertainment all increase Ambience. A fancy, invite-only
                    restaurant would have +3 Ambience, whereas a dug-out shelter
                    on a warzone would have an Ambience of -3.

                2. Deliciousness (-3<->+3)

                    This refers to how good the food is. If a Character has a
                    high Attempt on their Prepare Food Challenge, they produce
                    delicious food. +3 Food is prepared by master chefs, whereas
                    -3 food was probably fished out of a dumpster or worse.

                3. Security

                    This refers to how safe your Characters *feel* while they
                    are eating. If your Character feels pampered, protected, and
                    important, Security will be +3. If your group feels the need
                    to have someone keep watch while everyone else eats, or if
                    they're aware that they're actively being hunted by Bounty
                    Hunters, then Security will be -3.

            To determine the overall Quality of a meal, you take the average of
            the above scores. It's possible to have a negative value for a Meal,
            meaning that it provides less Satiation than what would have
            normally been supplied.

        Effects

            These are additional effects that the food your Character is
            consuming has. These can be either negative or positive. Different
            types of food give different effects.
