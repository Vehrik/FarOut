BOONS & QUIRKS
===============

At Birth you may optionally exchange 1 Slant in order to gain 3 Boon Points or
Quirk Points. After this, you must have the appropriate amount of Prestige and
Wealth in order to gain additional Boon/Quirk Points in the form of Items,
Equipment and Boons.

Boon/Quirk Points may be exchanged for anything from to fangs, to AI-designed
martial arts, to acid breath, to wrist mounted laser cannons.

Whatever your Boon is, it represents a change to your character's body that is
either mechanical, technological or biological that warrants the effect it
grants you.

If your character able to reach out and touch someone 30ft away, for example, it
means something along the lines of your character is able to shoot web, it has a
tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted harpoon launcher. The exact
description of a Boon depends on the Character's back-story, the function of
the Boon and the narrative context of the game you are playing.

Your Boon is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties inform
the Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Boons won't be
able to influence creature statistics like Swagger, Grit, and Stress more than
is defined by their Properties, but the resulting Aesthetics may allow for
creative applications or unforeseen consequences within the Narrative. 

For example, having fangs would make intimidating people slightly easier (and
thus grant a Bang), but would make comforting a distressed child harder.  Oozing
acid would be a great way to make people respect your personal space, but makes
finding a restaurant that's willing to seat you almost impossible. Having a
glowing diamond embedded into your forehead would mean you're never totally in
the dark unless it was obscurred, but would make it impossible to sneak around
at night unless you had something to cover it with.

Whatever your Boon ends up being you must decide on the following three
details:

        1. The location of the Boon. You may designate the Boon as being
           anchored to, being projected from or embedded in either your
           Torso, Arms, Legs or Head.

           Multiple Boons may be anchored to/embedded in the same portion of
           your body. Boons may become less effective or even unuseable if the
           body part the Boon is associated with becomes Injured or Disabled. 

           Boons are always assumed to perserve the original function of the
           limb, but any additional function (i.e. flinging a laser-sword out
           30ft) needs to be purchased as normal.

           You may optionally designate the Boon as a Crux, giving you 3
           additional Boon Points to use on the Boon designated as a
           Crux, but if the Crux is damaged, it could Fail Catastrophically. The
           more potent the Crux, the more dangerous it becomes for its user.

           Boons can also be designated a Token, giving you an additional Boon
           Point to use on the Boon designated as a Crux. Tokens are treated as
           Items for all purposes. They may be stowed or Plucked from your Haul
           and have a Burden equivalent to 1 :: 4 of every Boon Points spent.

        2. The material the Boon is made of. A Boon may be comprised
           of either Metal, Biomass or Energy or some combination thereof.
           It will influence to what degree certain hazards will effect your
           Character. Each category of material will also incur one of the
           following bonuses based on which material the Boon is
           *mostly* comprised of:
                
                    Metal - You gain +2 Swagger and the limb automatically
                    qualifies as a Crude Weapon with a Damage of 2 and a Threat
                    of 0. You may expand upon this Damage if you make the
                    Boon capable of causing Stress at Melee Range. 

                    Biomass - As long as the Boon is not a Crux, the Player
                    may choose to have the Boon Concealed with no additional
                    Boon/Quirk Point Cost. Damaged Biomass Boons may be forced
                    to work as normal by expending 1 Grit for a single use. You
                    may also expend 2 Grit in order to force a Disabled Biomass
                    Boon to work for a single use as if it were merely
                    Damaged or as normal by expending 3 Grit.

                    Energy - The Boon gains a Range of 20ft, 1 Point of
                    Stress and 5ft of Area for no additional cost. 

        3. The general dimensions of the Boon. You don't need to have
           the measurements down to the inch, but you need a solid concept
           of whether the shoulder mounted flamethrower means you're adding
           3 seperate wine-bottle sized cynlinders onto your upper arm, or
           if you're carrying what amounts to a backpack filled with jet
           fuel 

           This mass isn't anymore vulnerable than any other part of the
           body unless the Boon is also a Crux, in which case you need
           to carefully considered how to distribute the mass of your
           Boon. While not meant to be exact, the general guideline for
           a Boon/Quirk Points to Volume relationship is 1 litre of distilled
           water to 1 Boon/Quirk Point spent. 


FANGS, BIG MUSCLES, AND TELEKINETIC PLASMA SWORDS
==================================================

Most of the times where you acquire a Boon, it will be designed by your GM,
but while designing your Character, you have a rare opportunity to design a
Boon from the ground up.

You do this by purchasing properties for a Natural Weapon, or by purchasing
individual Augmentations for your Avatar's underlining physiology.

Each property for Natural Weapons build on each other, meaning that if you buy
Range, Stress and Area, it implies that you fire off a projectile or otherwise
interact with a part of the Game World that's X ft away and over an Y Area, and
cause Z Stress to any Creatures caught within that Area at the intended
distance.

The Effects of Natural Weapons are where they truly begin to differentiate. It's
one thing to get caught in a Fire Ball, but another thing entirely to then have
that Fire Ball suck you into it as it incinerate everything it touches.

Be creative with your Boons! You can't be good at everything, but being able
to snatch items out of the hands of hostiles is equally as valuable at being
able to breath neurotoxic acid into people's face.

If designing your own abilities sounds intimidating or like too much footwork,
don't worry, there's over (XXX) pre-designed Natural Weapons and Augmentations
in the Boon Codex that's paired with this document.

Just before diving in, you need to know that products of Boons are comprised of
a generic pseudo-material called Gyst. Gyst behaves like non-flammable wood as a
solid, potable water as a liquid, and breathable (to humans!) air as a gas.

Adding properties to a Boon always builds off its Gyst baseline. You can make
solid Gyst magnetic or combustable or whatever else the game rules (and the GM)
enables you to do, but it will always *want* to behave like a non-flammable wood
where you didn't provide a behaviour.

TOXIC LOOGEYS AND KNIFE-ANKLES
------------------------------

### RANGE (R)
#### COST: 1 Boon/Quirk Points per 20ft

    Having a Boon with Range means that you may apply the effects to a
    single designated Target Creature/Object that's within the radius of the
    Boon's Range. If the Object is a Creature or otherwise is cabable of
    reacting to things, they will be given the opportunity to avoid/resist the
    effects of the Boon. 

    A single Boon Activation may have multiple branches of Range, such that
    multiple Creatures/Objects may be targeted at once, but only up to a
    fraction of the total Range bought.

    Projectiles always travel in straight lines, and require Line of Sight in
    order to target a point in the Game World. This projectile is of arbitrary
    size and shape that cannot be larger than 1ft x 1ft x 1ft, but once these
    things are decided on, it remains constant.

    After you have purchased the Range of a Boon, you may decide to
    designate the Range as Artillary Range. This quarters the total Range of a
    Projectile, but allows you to target points in the Game World that you do
    not have Line of Sight for assuming you can form a parabolic arc between
    your Character and the targetted point.

    Range by-itself implies you are extending out a pseudo-limb that is
    vulnerable 


### AREA (A)
#### COST: 1 Boon/Quirk Points per 12ft of Area.

    A Boon with Area is able to apply their effects over a large amount of
    space. Every Boon with Area has its Point of Origin placed somewhere on
    the Boon itself.

    When a Boon is activated, its Area propagates from its Point of Origin
    instanteously at either the moment of activation, or when the Point of
    Origin contacts something in the Game World, or at designated Sprout Points. 

    You may also divide the Area of the Boon up into seperate portions, such
    that when 1 portion of the Area contacts something in the Game World, the
    remaining Area begins to propagate from the Point(s) of Contact, utilizing
    Range as normal. Each stage of Area may impart/utilize different portions of
    the Boons other properties as desired, but its perfectly acceptable to
    make all portions do the same things. 

    When a Boon has Area and Range, the Point of Origin may be projected
    away from the Avatar up to the Range. You may decide to project the Point of
    Origin up to a portion of the range, then project the generated material
    away from the Point of Contact up to the remaining range. A Boon's
    products propagate from this Point of Origin, but a Point of Origin does not
    necessarily have to be in the centre of an object.

    When given Area, the product must have at least 1ft of Height, Width and
    Length. The Area of a Boon can only impart its effects on a
    Creature/Point of Contact once per round.

    Your Creature can only produce an amount of Area totalling the Area of the
    Threat. This means that with 12ft of Area, you can produce a maximum of 4
    projectiles (as each projectile must have at least 3ft of Area) before you
    need to let your Avatar's body recoup the expended material/energy. They
    recover 10 + Heart + Brawn feet of Area every hour, and double that plus 2
    feet every hour while taking a Break. If a Creature has a Broken Heart and
    Brawn Core, they don't replenish Area at all.

### INTEGRITY
#### COST: 1 Boon/Quirk Points per 3 Integrity
    
    A Boon with Integrity implicitely creates tangible material that
    persists until destroyed. A Boon with Integrity must have Area as well.
    The products of a Boon do not necessarily have to fill the Area
    completely, but must touch each boundary of the Area at least once.
         
    Products with Integrity can be gas, liquid or solid. 
            
    #####Gas
    
        Gas fills any container it is placed in, spreading outward from Point of
        Origin and moving in the same direction as the strongest
        non-gravitational force acting on it each Moment. 

        If able, gasses will exchange 1 Integrity for 3ft of Area each Moment in
        order to fill the container, and prefer to distribute the Area between
        Length, Width and Height equally. 

        In addition to the Integrity exchanged for Area, gasses loses an
        additional point of Integrity per round unless they are in a container
        that slows or stops dispersal. Your GM is at liberty to decide the
        Integrity Lost per Moment of a Gas in special circumstances, but should
        never climb above 10/Moment except in partial or total vacuums. Gasses
        can't be Challenged by Actions that normally wouldn't be able to dispel
        clouds of gas.

        Any force that would feasibly push the entirity of the gas will use its
        Challenge to generate a Stride for the cloud of Gas. This is done at the
        GM's discretion.

        Gasses may be placed into containers or otherwise transported with
        equipment in order to extend their effective Range or Area. 

        Gasses may be reapplied to a space, but will seek to expand its Length,
        Width and Height equally with the newly given mass. If it cannot expand
        its Area, it will bolster its Integrity up to a total of 5, and become
        totally opaque.

        Gas always has a Momentum of 0.


    #####Liquid

        Liquid fills any container it is placed in, spreading outward from Point
        of Origin and moving in the same direction as the strongest force acting
        on it each Moment. 

        Once formed, Liquids will seek to exchange all its Height for Length and
        Width where possible, and does so the Moment after they were created.
        Liquids lose 1 Integrity per round. 

        Liquids can't be Challenged by Actions that normally wouldn't be able to
        displace or evaporate liquids.

        Liquids may be placed into containers, suspended in other fluids and
        coated over solids in order to impart their effects through creative
        means. 

        Liquids may be reapplied to a space, but will seek to expand its Width
        and Length before adding to its Height with the newly given mass. If it
        cannot expand its Area, it will bolster its Integrity up to a total of
        10.

        Liquids have a Momentum equivalent to Integrity/5.

    #####Solid

        Solids fill the space designated by Player up the Area, not changing
        shape, but still traveling in the same direction as the strongest force
        acting on it each Moment assuming the force is strong enough to overcome
        the product's Momentum. 

        Solids do not lose Integrity every round, and remain permanently affixed
        in the Game World until they are destroyed by opposing forces, but may
        be Challenged by any Actions that would normally be able to damage solid
        materials. 

        Solids may also be 'layered', meaning that you may reapply the
        Boon's products to an area already occupied by previously generated
        products in order to add to the Integrity. You may layer Integrity up to
        a total of 25 points. Layering does not expand the Area of a Solid
        unless the Integrity has been bolstered up to 25 at the point of
        layering.

        Solids have a Momentum equivalent to their Integrity when
        first formed, but when partially damaged or broken into smaller pieces
        have a Momentum determined by the GM. 

    Whenever a product with Integrity is Challenged, it loses 1 point of
    Integrity. If a product with Integrity encounters a Challenge 5 or more
    points higher than its Integrity, it is instantly reduced to 0 Integrity.
    When a product or a portion of it has its Integrity reduced to 0, it is
    destroyed and becomes useless.

    With large products that can reasonably be broken multiple times, the GM
    determines how it breaks, but no less than a 5ft x 5ft x 5ft cube of
    material is destroyed when a portion of a product has its Integrity reduced
    to 0.


    Without purchasing Area, Integrity implies the production of a Gyst-mass no
    larger than 1ftx1ftx1ft.
    

### STRESS
#### COST: 3 Boon/Quirk Points per 1 point of Stress

    Stress directly harms the Cores of Creatures that contact a Boon's Area
    of Effect, or are otherwise designated at the Target of a Trait that only
    has Range.

    You must designate Stress as either Slowness, Weakness, Distraction, or
    Erosion when you buy it. A single Boon may output all 4 types of Stress
    at once. For every 5 points of Stress bought, you may convert it into
    Trauma.


### POWER
#### COST: 2 Boon/Quirk Points per 1 Power
        
    Power implies beneficial properties/behaviours that your Boon imposes on
    the Game World. Power can take three forms: Boost, Effect, and Heal.

    #####BOOST

        If you designate Power as Boost, on Boon Activation the Boosting
        Power is added to the targeted Creature's Core. When you designate Power
        as Boost, you must designate which Core it applies to. As normal, a
        Creature's Core can't be set to a value higher than +5, but they may
        Super Charged with the use of Power. 

        If a Creature's Core is boosted, after it stops benefiting from Boost for
        a Moment it incurs 1 point of Stress, and if it was Super Charged, it
        incurs 3 points of Stress. If a product supplies Boost, it loses point
        of Integrity every Round.

        Boost can also be imbued into products of a Boon or objects. When
        this is done, they become Tools, and can be used to strengthen specific
        Actions. These tasks must all be something that the form of the object
        lends itself to. Whenever you use for an intended purpose, you add its
        Boost to the Action. 

        These Tasks can be anything an Avatar could do bare-handed or with an
        appropriate apparatus, assuming your Boons' products qualify as
        something minimally appropriate for the intended tasks.

        Tools lose 1 point of Integrity every time they are used for an
        Challenge greater than their Integrity, and break immediately if they
        are used for a Challenge that is 5 or more Difficulty higher than their
        Integrity. Tools may be Challenged and broken as normal for their
        material type.

    #####EFFECT
    
        You may designate the Power as Effect Power. Effects can be anything an
        Avatar could do bare-handed or with an appropriate tool, assuming your
        Boons qualifies as a minimally appropriate tool for the intended
        effect. 

        Effects are very similar to typical Actions, except instead of using a
        Core, they merely use the Effect Power of the Boon. You may give
        your Effects activation conditions or give it an activation time, but
        every time it imparts its Effect, it loses 1 point of Integrity. You
        can't add Risk to Effects.

        An Effect can't be made stronger with Aesthetics. If your shovel-hands
        have a +5 Dig Effect, they'll always be better than your friend's
        lazer-drill-hands with a +2 Dig Effect. As always, a GM might present
        situations where certain Aesthetics or Forms get in the way or make
        certain tasks easier, or even render certain tasks impossible, but
        you'll never get raw numbered bonuses from Aesthetics.

    #####HEALING

        You may also designate Power as Healing Power, which may doled out to
        cleanse away Stress or Trauma. Healing Power is a limited resource
        similar to Swagger and Grit, and if a Boon could feasibly impart
        Healing Power on multiple creatures, it must be distributed evenly
        amongst all of them, but with the Creature closest to the Point of
        Origin receiving any remainder. 

        You must designate Healing Power as either Soothing or Revitilization.
        Revitilzation can be applied to Physical (Brawn or Speed) Stress and
        Soothing can be applied to Mental (Brain or Heart) Stress.

        Each point of Trauma requires 4 points of Healing Power to remove, whereas
        Stress is removed at a rate of 1 Healing Power to 1 Stress relieved. 

        You recover expended Healing Power at a rate equal to  (Heart + Brawn)
        per hour, and double that per hour of Break. While on a Break, you
        recover at least 1 point of Healing Power regardless of your Heart and
        Brawn Cores. You can't leak Healing Power due to a negative Heart +
        Brawn total.

### CONCEALMENT
#### COST: 2 Boon/Quirk Points per 1 Power


ANATOMY MUTATIONS
-----------------

### BONUS SWAGGER
#### COST: 2 Boon/Quirk Points per 1 Bonus Swagger 

    Your Creature's Swagger is increased by 1 per point of Bonus Swagger
    purchased. You aren't able to accumulate more than 15 Swagger as normal.

### BONUS GRIT
#### COST: 2 Boon/Quirk Points per 1 Bonus Grit.

    Your Creature's Grit is increased by 1 per point of Bonus Grit
    purchased.

### BONUS HAUL
#### COST: 3 Boon/Quirk Points per Bonus Haul Slot. 

    The Size of a Creature's Haul is increased by 1 per Bonus Haul Slot
    purchased. 


### SENSE ENHANCEMENT
#### COST: 2 Boon/Quirk Points per 3 Sense Points

    You are able to enhance your Senses with either direct Try Bonuses, or
    unique sight enhancments that broaden the spectrum of how your Character can
    perceive the Game World.

    This system is described within the Physiology section of this book. Amongst
    other things, you can gain the ability to see in the dark, or sense the
    heart beats of other Creatures.

### RESIZE
#### COST: 3 Boon/Quirk Points per Size Category  
    
    There are 3 Size Categories that Player Characters can be created under.
    From smallest to largest they are:

         Small 
         Medium
         Big     

    Each size has various properties that alter your Character's baseline
    physiology. These alternations are not all beneficial. Each Size Category is
    explained in detail in the Physiology section.

DAMAGED MUTATIONS 
=================

Boons aren't just balls of numbers that you tap your finger on to make the
bad guys go away. They're relics of your Characters story AND features on your
Character's anatomy. A Character more than likely sees there Boon as a part
of their body or at least as a important item that deserves respect. Regardless,
you will more than likely damage your Boon.

Boons have a chance to become Damaged whenever the limb their attached
to/housed within become Damaged. It depends on how hard the hit was, but a
Damaged Boon can be either Malfunctioning or Disabled.

Using a Malfunctioning Boon incurs a Bust whenever you are using it. A
Disabled Boon cannot be used at all.

Crux can Catastrophically Fail if they become Damaged.  When a Crux is damaged,
the GM draws one card from Fate. Every time you use a Damaged Crux, the GM with
draw another card from Fate. When they get a card that matches the number or
suit of the first card drawn, they stack that card on top of the first one
drawn. When the stack reaches a total of 3 cards, the Crux Catastrophically
Fails. If they draw a Joker at any point of creating this stack, the Crux
Catastrophically fails. The Players shouldn't know how big the stack is at any
given point.

You may exchange 2 Grit to subtract 1 Card from this stack, but you won't know
the new size of a stack, and you won't be to reduce the size of this stack to
less than 1.

When a Crux Catastrophically Fails, it imparts all its negative effects on its
owner as if it was activated with a Try of 15. The owner automatically fails any
Challenges applied to them due to a Catastrophically Failing Crux.

If the Crux is a Quirk, half of all of the Quirk Points placed into it are
treated as Trauma that applies to its owner directly. The GM applies this Trauma
as they see fit.

Boost is treated as Stress in these instances. If the Boon has Range,
Effects, or an Area, the GM has free reign to direct the Boon's involuntary
activation as they see fit.
