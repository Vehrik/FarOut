ZONES, BORDERS, & PATHS
=======================

Every Scenario has one or more Zones. 

Zones are categorized by how far they are from other Zones, but keep in mind
that Zones that are spatially adjacent may as well be considered further away if
significant obstacles exist at the border of the two Zones in question. 

The general distances are as follows, but keep in mind that your GM may assign a
different distance to Zones depending on the Context.

        Very Close   +0 
        Close        +2
        Far          +5
        Very Far     +12

The shape and sizes of Zones are not permanent. In fact, many Creatures
possess abilities or have access to items that will either divide Zones into
smaller ones, or completely remove them from the Scenario.

A Zone is meant to be around 20 square feet in total area, but this does not
mean that Zones won't end up being larger or smaller.

In the same way, some participants of a Scenario will be able to reach some
Zones that others cannot. Most likely, this will be due to some Creatures being
able to move about the Game World in ways that others cannot, such as by flying.
In such cases where Characters are able to move both vertically and
horizontally, Zones are considered to have height as well as width, though by no
means do these two measurements have to be proportional to each-other.

Features that divide the Scenario into its composite Zones are referred to as
Borders, whereas the features that connect two or more Zones (often bypassing or
circumventing Borders) are referred to as Paths.

Both Paths and Borders add or remove Difficulty to any Challenge that is
completed while crossing them. Different Paths and Borders will invoke different
Challenges. 

For example, ramming through a thin wooden door that separates two Zones would
be a Brawn Challenge, whereas vaulting over a wall that sits between two Zones
would be a Speed Challenge.

It's very possible for a singular Path or Border to add Difficulty
when approaching it from one direction, but remove Difficulty when approaching
it from another. It's also likely that approaching a Path or Border from
different directions will cause the Difficulty they add/remove to fluctuate.

MOVING BETWEEN ZONES
--------------------

In each Scenario, a Creature has 3 Actions/Reactions they can complete during
each Round. Moving between Zones require either an Action or Reaction. In order
to determine whether or not you move between two Zones, your GM will total the
Difficulty supplied by the distance between the Zones and the nature of their
Borders and/or Paths.

You then complete the appropriate Challenge(s). Successfully beating the Challenge
will allow you to move to the Zone you designated through the Path who's
Challenge you completed. As always, you may decide to Double or Triple Down on a
single Action/Reaction, but Flopping while moving between Zones will result in
your Character Tripping in addition to whatever effects failure has on your
Situation.

SPACE, THREAT, AND REACH
------------------------

Space refers to any discernible, unoccupied area within the Game World. Due to
the nature of the game, the exact square-footage of a certain Space is best left
to approximation and mental heuristics. At the same time, certain abilities,
items, and narrative components have explicitly sized products or forms. When
given exact dimensions, they are meant to be adhered to closely and should act
as landmarks when describing the shape, size and position of less explicitly
defined features. 

Your Character is considered to Threaten a certain amount of Space within a
Scenario. To Threaten something means that should a creature, object, or item take
an Action/Reaction, your Character is able to invoke a Reaction of your own
assuming you haven't used up all your Actions for a Round. Creatures Threaten
everything that occupies the same Zone as them, but can potentially Threaten
Creatures that are multiple Zones away if they have enough Reach.

Some weapons and mutations give your Character Reach. Reach is similar to Range
in that it allows you to attack things that are multiple Zones away. The key
difference is that having Reach increases the amount of Space you Threaten,
whereas Range does not.

SHAKING THINGS UP
-----------------

Actions (and Reactions) have consequences on the Game World. Sometimes these
consequences cascade and end up altering the Scenario significantly. When this
happens the GM will have to re-describe the Scenario and reform the Zones.

There are many reasons why a Zone would change its shape/size. Maybe a Thrasher
just fired a ray from their Cryo-Cannon, causing a 15ft tall wall of ice to
sprout from ground, cleaving the lobby of the bank in half. Maybe you're in a
burning building with thick black smoke obfuscating your vision and tendrils of
fire snaking all around you, causing the Zones to shrink and shift between every
Round.

In any event, the placement of Borders and Paths are more important in
deciding how to traverse a Scenario than the size of the Zones themselves


        Ahrissa and Vulcan are pursuing a serial killer by the true name of Alix
        Marin. They've tracked him down to a mining outpost a few Jumps away
        from Central. 

        "1,000,000 Credits for a new Skin and he ends up here?" asked Vulcan.
        "My lungs are already itchy from all the cancer."

        "That's what the Spider said. He's also changed his name to 'Jack
        Freeman' of all things," answered Ahrissa.

        Vulcan opened his mouth to belt out another quip, but Ahrissa placed a
        palm on his chest. "I just saw him slip into the canteen."

        "Think he noticed us?" asked Vulcan, wiping pink and yellow dust out
        of the vents of his arm cannon.

        "The canteen doesn't have a back-door, so I doubt it, but its best to
        assume he did."
        
        Between them and the canteen there is a sizeable crowd of people. This
        crowd isn't fully preventing movement, but it is slowing it down.
        Therefore it is a Path with a Difficulty of +2.


MOMENTUM & BURDEN
=================

Your Momentum is used to determine the damage you take from Falls, Trips and
collisions as well as how easy it is to propel your Character by means other
than Stride. In addition, it is used to determine how hard it is to catch
yourself mid-fall or Trip. 

Momentum is 5 by default, but has a boundless range. Your Character can lift
at maximum twice their Momentum. Your own personal Momentum is not counted
towards this total, but otherwise everything you carry/wear is given a
Momentum score and the sum of these scores is considered your Burden. 

If your Burden is higher than your Character's base Momentum but lower than
double their Momentum, your Character Busts whenever attempting to move between
Zones, and they may only make one Action per round of Combat, and this action is
made with a Bust. This condition is known as Burden I. 

If your Burden is equal to twice your Character's Momentum Score, your
Character is unable to move and may not preform any other Actions
than Attempting to remove its Burden. This is known as Burden II.

Attempting to lift a Burden that is higher than your Momentum is automatically
failed, but one should keep in mind that the Momentum of something can be
reduced/increased without actually adding or removing mass from the object
you're trying to lift. Things like balance, friction, leverage and gravity may
change the Momentum of an object.
