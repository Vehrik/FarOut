STAMINA, EXHAUSTION, & LEANS

  You Character is considered to have a pool of energy that it pulls from in
  order to complete Challenges. This pool is represented by the Play Deck.
  Every time you complete a Challenge, you discard the card face up. This
  discard pile is referred to as your Sleeve. When your Play Deck is empty and
  your Sleeve is full, you must expend 1 Stamina in order to empty your Sleeve
  and shuffle it to make a new Play Deck.

  Alternatively, you may take on a level of Exhaustion in order to replenish
  your Play Deck. Doing so also forces you to discard the first 13 cards that
  are on the top of the newly formed Deck. These 13 Cards are discard face down
  in a pile separate from the Sleeve. These cards cannot be recovered until you
  take a Rest.



  ~~Your Character is considered to have two reservoirs of
  "energy". One is accessed by taking short-breaks, whereas the other typically
  indicates a certain degree of desperation. They are known as Chakras, and are
  marked as either your Upper Chakra and your Lower Chakra.

    Whenever your Character attempts a Challenge, the card drawn from the Play
    Deck is placed into your Upper Chakra with its face pointing downward. This
    is the typical Card discarding motion. These cards are trapped in the Upper
    Chakra, unable to be used, until the Chakra is emptied by expending Stamina.
    
    You may either expend 1 point of Stamina or take a -1 penalty to a
    Capacity in order to move the cards in the Upper Chakra into the Play Deck, then
    shuffle the newly replenished Play Deck.
    
    You may expend Stamina At Will. This means you can do it during your Turn or
    anyone else's Turn during combat. 
    
    Some items, spells, narrative events, and environmental hazards Exhaust the
    Character. When Exhausted, before the Creature Attempts another Challenge, all
    Cards that were in the Character's Upper Chakra are placed into the Lower Chakra
    with their face pointing downward. While Exhausted, all discarded Cards go into
    your Lower Chakra.
    
    Cards in the Lower Chakra may be recovered in the same way you may recover cards
    in the Upper Chakra, but the Stamina/Core Penalty cost is doubled. Cards that
    fall into the Lower Chakra remain there until bought back with Stamina.
    
    Stamina is only recovered after a Rest assuming the Character's nutritional needs are
    met. Alternatively, a Character is able to take a Break and recover 13 Cards from the
    Upper Chakra per hour they Break for.~~
