ZONES, BORDERS, & PATHS
=======================

Every Scenario has one or more Zones. Zones are intuitive divisions of space
within a given moment of play. Each Character a certain amount of space within a
Zone (given in fractions of the Zones they take up). This does not mean that
Characters are literally taking up 1/4 of a Zone as if they were a gaseous body.
It merely refers to how much space someone in an active combat scenario
generally takes.

Zones are categorized by how far they are from other Zones, but keep in mind
that Zones that are spatially adjacent may as well be considered further away if
significant obstacles exist at the border of the two Zones in question. 

The general distances are as follows, but keep in mind that your GM may assign a
different distance and Challenge Modifier to Zones depending on the Context.

        Distance Class       "Real" Distance                 Move Challenge Modifier
        --------------       ---------------                 -----------------------
        Very Close           0->20ft (Same Zone)             +0 
        Close                20->40ft (~1-2 Zone Away)       +2
        Far                  40->60ft (~2-3 Zones Away)      +5
        Very Far             >60ft (3+ Zones Away)           +12

The shape and sizes of Zones are not permanent. In fact, many Creatures
possess abilities or have access to items that will either divide Zones into
smaller ones, or completely remove them from the Scenario.

In the same way, some participants of a Scenario will be able to reach some
Zones that others cannot. Most likely, this will be due to some Creatures being
able to move about the Game World in ways that others cannot, such as by flying.
In such cases where Characters are able to move both vertically and
horizontally, Zones are considered to have height as well as width, though by no
means do these two measurements have to be proportional to each-other.

Features that divide the Scenario into its composite Zones are referred to as
Borders, whereas the features that connect two or more Zones (often bypassing or
circumventing Borders) are referred to as Paths.

Both Paths and Borders add or remove Difficulty to any Challenge that is
completed while crossing them. Different Paths and Borders will invoke different
Challenges. 

It's very possible for a singular Path or Border to add Difficulty
when approaching it from one direction, but remove Difficulty when approaching
it from another. It's also likely that approaching a Path or Border from
different directions will cause the Difficulty they add/remove to fluctuate.

MOVING BETWEEN ZONES
--------------------

In each Scenario, a Creature has 3 Actions/Reactions they can complete during
each Round. Moving between Zones require either an Action or Reaction. In order
to determine whether or not you move between two Zones, your GM will total the
Difficulty supplied by the distance between the Zones and the nature of their
Borders and/or Paths. 

You then complete the appropriate Challenge(s). Successfully beating the Challenge
will allow you to move to the Zone you designated through the Path who's
Challenge you completed. 

A Zone is no more than 20sq ft, but often it will be less than that due to
Borders and Paths.

In situations where you fail the Move Challenge, instead of moving the maximum
intended distance, you move a shorter distance that was along the path you were
moving, as appropriate for the Attempt made.

As always, you may decide to Double or Triple Down on a single Move
Action/Reaction, but Flopping while moving between Zones will result in your
Character Tripping in addition to whatever effects failure has on your
Situation.

Movement is not done with just your Speed Core. Move Challenges will call for
Speed the vast majority of the time, but as with all Challenges, it is an equal
mixture of intuition and GM preference. In order to move between adjacent Zones,
you can be asked to Attempt any type of Challenge. For example, moving through a
large, meandering crowd of people is often more of a question of body language
(Heart) or how pushy you can be (Brawn). Moving between non-adjacent Zones will
always involve at least 1 Speed Challenge, but often invoke additional
Challenges.

SPACE, THREAT, AND REACH
------------------------

Space refers to any discernible, unoccupied area within the Game World. Due to
the nature of the game, the exact square-footage of a certain Space is best left
to approximation and mental heuristics. At the same time, certain abilities,
items, and narrative components have explicitly sized products or forms. When
given exact dimensions, they are meant to be adhered to closely and should act
as landmarks when describing the shape, size and position of less explicitly
defined features. 

Your Character is considered to Threaten a certain amount of Space within a
Scenario. To Threaten something means that should a creature, object, or item take
an Action/Reaction, your Character is able to invoke a Reaction of your own
assuming you haven't used up all your Actions for a Round. Creatures Threaten
everything that occupies the same Zone as them, but can potentially Threaten
Creatures that are multiple Zones away if they have enough Reach.

Some weapons and mutations give your Character Reach. Reach is similar to Range
in that it allows you to attack things that are multiple Zones away. The key
difference is that having Reach increases the amount of Space you Threaten,
whereas Range does not. While not without exception, Reach is often only make
you capable of targeting something that's 1 or 2 Zones away, where as Range
typically allows you to target Creatures that are 3 or more Zones away.

SHAKING THINGS UP
-----------------

Actions (and Reactions) have consequences on the Game World. Sometimes these
consequences cascade and end up altering the Scenario significantly. When this
happens the GM will have to re-describe the Scenario and reform the Zones.

There are many reasons why a Zone would change its shape/size. Maybe a Thrasher
just fired a ray from their Cryo-Cannon, causing a 15ft tall wall of ice to
sprout from ground, cleaving the lobby of the bank in half. Maybe you're in a
burning building with thick black smoke obfuscating your vision and tendrils of
fire snaking all around you, causing the Zones to shrink and shift between every
Round.

Every time a Zone you're in changes shape, you must shuffle your deck, but you
cannot be forced to shuffle your deck more than 3 times per round.

In any event, the placement of Borders and Paths are more important in
deciding how to traverse a Scenario than the size of the Zones themselves

TAKING COVER, APPLYING PRESSURE AND FLANKING
----------------------------------------------

You won't survive long if you stand out in the open. Taking Cover is vital in
order to minimize the amount of Attacks you have to Dodge each round. 

Taking Cover is different to just being behind a wall that's larger that your
Character, this is referred to as being Untouchable. Taking Cover implies that
you Character has to stoop, bend, or even go prone in order to take advantage of
the environment in order to make themselves a harder target.

Whatever you are Taking Cover behind must be at least half the size of your
Character. There are 3 different ways to Take Cover. 

Hovering - 

    Hovering implies that you are standing near the cover and are ready
    to duck behind it at any moment and are able to peak out of it in order to
    make quick attacks. Any Attacks made against you while Hovering
    are made with a Bust as long as the cover is at least partially between your
    Character and the assailant.

Squeezing - 

    This implies that your Character had to go into an awkward position
    in order to utilize the cover. Whenever you Squeeze into Cover, Attacks made
    against you are made with a Bust as long as the cover is at least partially
    between your Character and the assailant. You also Bang on any Active Dodges
    you take against Attacks made by assailants as long as the cover is at least
    partially between you and them. As long as you are Squeezed, you
    may only perform 2 Actions per Round. Unsqueezing during a Round does not
    restore the dropped Action for that Round.

Praying - 

    This implies that your Character is using something that is charitably
    called "non-convential" cover. Praying under Cover is darting behind a thin
    lamp post and having it miraculously block the bullet, or having an elevator
    door close just in time to catch the angry end of a spear or pulling your
    hand up out of reflex and having the knife bite into your wrist-watch
    instead of your face.

    You Pray by sacrificing 2 Actions, 1 Strike in lieu of 2 Actions. You can
    Pray even if you exhausted all your Actions for a Round if you decide to
    expend a Strike.
    
    You and your assailant then draw 2 Cards each and compare colours. If all 4
    Cards match in colour, the Prayer is answered and circumstances will
    conspire to force the Attack to miss. Otherwise, the Attack proceeds as
    normal. A single Joker present in any of the 4 Cards causes the Prayer to go
    unanswered.

    You must be aware of the Attack that's coming in order to Pray.

MOMENTUM & BURDEN
=================

Your Momentum is used to determine the damage you take from Falls, Trips and
collisions as well as how easy it is to propel your Character by means other
than Stride. In addition, it is used to determine how hard it is to catch
yourself mid-fall or Trip. 

Momentum is 5 by default, but has a boundless range. Your Character can lift
at maximum twice their Momentum. Your own personal Momentum is not counted
towards this total, but otherwise everything you carry/wear is given a
Momentum score and the sum of these scores is considered your Burden. 

If your Burden is higher than your Character's Momentum but lower than double
their Momentum, your Character Busts whenever attempting to move between Zones,
and they may only make one Action per round of Combat, and this action is made
with a Bust. This condition is known as Burden I. This means that you may
effectively lift another entire adult human worth of stuff before you're slowed
down noticeable (quite an impressive baseline ability by 2020 standards!) 

If your Burden is equal to twice your Character's Momentum Score, your
Character is unable to move and may not preform any other Actions
than Attempting to remove its Burden. This is known as Burden II.

Attempting to lift a Burden that is higher than your Momentum is automatically
failed, but one should keep in mind that the Momentum of something can be
reduced/increased without actually adding or removing mass from the object
you're trying to lift. Things like balance, friction, leverage and gravity may
change the Momentum of an object between attempts to lift it.
