VITALS
======

Every Character has Vitals. Vitals are statistics generated from the Core Stats.
As you will see, they embody certain aspects of your Character that change how
they interact with the Game World. Among other things, Vitals determine how much
damage your Character can sustain, how difficult it is to damage them in the
first place and how much they can lift.

LUCK            
----
[6] + HEART 
-----------

    In a world of plasma rifles, nanobot swarms and rogue A.I.'s, it doesn't
    really matter how much soft, squishy flesh you have wrapped around your
    soft, squishy organs. If you have a 4-inch round hole burned into your neck,
    you're going down, and in the Silk, almost every gun can tear through metal
    like it's paper.

    Every time you lose Luck, think of it as a "close call". Whether that's a
    few singed hairs or a broken ankle depends on how Luck you have left-over
    after getting Hit.

    When you take Damage, you lose an equal amount of Luck. If a Character is
    reduced to 0 Luck and referred to as Out of Luck. Although someone's that
    Out of Luck is more than likely in very bad shape, they're still able to
    take Actions/Reactions unless Injuries prevent them from doing so. When your
    Out of Luck, you need to be careful, because the next bullet will bite into
    your face, as oppossed to the concrete 3 inches away from it. 

    What happens after the bullet, lance, or swarm of flying pirahnas is up to
    the GM, but don't worry, as long as your Heartstrings aren't cut, you can be
    brought back.

SKILL
-----
3 + BRAIN
---------

    Skill is a measure of how many things your Character can be good at. It's
    used to create Blitz, Weaves, and Talents. 

    Blitz are bonus effects that can be added onto Actions or Reactions. They
    leverage your Cores to do things like threaten a guard into dropping his
    gun, punting a Foxwasp out of your star-cruiser, or quadruple roundhouse
    kicking a Gremm in the face.

    Weaves are manipulations of the Silk that result in energy transferance
    across distance and the amplification of said energy. They can do everything
    from call down bolts of lightning to pinching someone's butt from a 200ft
    away. Weaving Silk is very difficult and prone to error, but if you manage
    to Weave something, the effects can be terrifying.

    Talents is a way to list what tasks your Character is particularly good at.
    It used a adjectve-noun structure that list a type of job your Character
    would be well suited for which builds a basis on which your Character may
    specialize.

HUSTLE
------
15ft + (5 x SPEED)ft
--------------------

    In High Stress Scenarios, your Character can only move specific distances as
    dictated by their Move Action. In addition to this movement, the Character
    can Hustle.

    At any point throughout your Turn, you may declare that your Character is
    Hustling as long as they are touching a surface they have a Stride for, and
    they are orientated correctly to Stride on that surface. When Hustling, your
    Character can move an amount of feet equal to their Hustle vital. You can
    only declare you're Hustling once, and any unused Hustle is discarded.

    While Hustling, if you encounter an Obstacle that imposes a Speed Challenge,
    you automatically suceed as long as your Character's movement both begins
    and ends in space that's unoccupied by Obstacles or Creatures. If an object
    is more than 1.5x higher than your Character, you must expend an amount of
    Hustle equivalent to the obstacle's height in order to reach the top of it.

    You are in 'Coyote Time' when Hustling, meaning that you can essentially run
    on air as long as you were on solid ground when you started Hustling.
    Hustling vertically without assistance from a vertical, solid object
    requires 15ft of Hustle per 5ft moved. If you Hustle in the same direction
    as the strongest force acting on you at the moment, you may move 10ft per
    5ft of Hustle spent.

    If you Hustle into a Fall, you ignore the amount of distance you Hustled
    when determining Fall Damage.

    Your Hustle Vital is also used when you Dodge in order to determine whether
    or not you are able to exit the Area of Effect of the hazardous force.

HAUL
----
[6] + BRAWN
-----------

    Not all that Wander are lost, but you sure will be if you don't have the
    proper gear. Your Haul is a measure of how much equipment, items, and
    food you can lug around at once.
    
    Instead of worrying about the weight, dimensions and storability of an
    object, your GM roll all these factors into 1 measurement and assigns
    something a Burden to reflect these things. Anything with Burden can be
    placed into your Haul if you have the means to fasten the object to your
    person, or place it into a container that can be fastened to your body.
    Things can be assigned any amount of burden, but must be given in increments
    of 1/10th of a Burden.

    A Burden takes up an equivalent amount of slots equal to its Burden, but a
    Slot only counts as full if you completely fill it. 

    What you carry in your Haul is seperate from how much mass your Character
    can actually move around with bruteforce, which is done using the Displace
    Action. If something is in your Haul, it indicates you were able to fasten
    it to your Creature or that otherwise that you had time to situate it along
    with the rest of your gear.    

    You can also Pluck things out the ether using your Haul's Super Slots.
    Super Slots are any Slots you designate as such, but they are considered to
    be filled for all purposes. Super Slots can be linked to anything that your
    Character owns/is being lent that is within the immediate reach of your
    Character.

    Say you're in a situation where you *really* need a Rejuve for your friend
    Mike who just lost an arm. Nobody else has one, and as a Player you had two
    Rejuves in a MedKit, but you figured you wouldn't need a third, so you left
    it at the hideout. You can decide to Pluck a Rejuve out of your Haul at the
    expense of some of your Super Slots. 

    The cost is calculated by adding 1 to the Burden of the Plucked Item AND
    rounding up to the nearest whole number. In this case, if you want to save
    Mike, you're going to need to expend 3 Super Slots. Two of these points are
    because that's how much space another MedKit takes up, and the third is
    because you had to Pluck it instead of being prepared and actually bringing
    one. 

    Items can be rolled into Kits arbitralily during Breaks and Rests, and you
    can Pluck entire Kits at once, but otherwise, Plucking something costs at
    minimum 2 Super Slots due to the rules described above. Super Slots are
    downgraded to normal empty slots the instant they are expended. 

    The size of your Haul factors into Fall Damage, and the difficulty of Speed
    Taps and how hard it is to stand up from Prone. 

SWAGGER
-------
3 + SPEED + BRAIN
-----------------
    
    Normally when a Creature encounters a hazard, they have to Check one of
    their Cores in order to avoid Damage and other unwanted effects. You do have
    the option of using Swagger in order to avoid a hazard as long as you
    weren't caught off guard and the Hazard Checks your Brain or Speed.

    When you Swagger, the hazard's damage and other effects are ignored and your
    Character gets away without so much as a scratch. You can't easily Swagger
    away from hazards that have an Area of Effect. If you try to Swagger against
    something that has an Area of Effect, you must also expend enough Hustle in
    order to exit the area of the attack. This Movement is referred to as
    Tumbling, and does not force you to discard remaining remaining Hustle as
    long as you don't Hustle into any space that the Area of Effect has touched
    in the same Round you're Tumbling in.

    Equipment, items and Traits can all supply Swagger, but you can't have more
    that 15 Dodge at once. If the Attack Tried for 15 or higher, you need to
    expend 3 Swagger as opposed to 1 in order to ignore it. Attacks that try for
    0 or lower miss automatically, but you still have to exit their Area of
    Effect if they have one.

    
GRIT 
----
5 + BRAWN + HEART
-----------------
    
    You have a number of Grit equivalent to 5 plus your Brawn and Heart Cores.

    Grit has a wide variety of uses. Among other things, Grit can be used
    to retry failed Challenges, nullify the effects of being Staggered, move
    quickly, interrupt enemy Actions and reduce Damage.

    You recover Grit by Taking A Break and Patching Up. Mutations, Elixirs and
    other items within the game can grant bonus Stamina beyond what is available
    from your Cores, but you can't have more than 20 Stamina at once.
