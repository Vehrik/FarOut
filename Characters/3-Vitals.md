VITALS
======

Every Character has Vitals. Vitals are statistics generated from the Core Stats.
As you will see, they embody certain aspects of your Character that change how
they interact with the Game World. Among other things, Vitals determine how much
damage your Character can sustain, how difficult it is to damage them in the
first place and how much they can lift.

SKILL
-----
5 + BRAIN
---------

    Skill is a measure of how many things your Character can be good at. It's
    used to create Blitz, Weaves, and Talents. 

    Blitz are bonus effects that can be added onto Actions or Reactions. They
    leverage your Cores to do things like threaten a guard into dropping his
    gun, punting a Foxwasp out of your star-cruiser, or quadruple roundhouse
    kicking a Gremm in the face.

    Weaves are manipulations of the Silk that result in energy transferance
    across distance and the amplification of said energy. They can do everything
    from call down bolts of lightning to pinch someone's butt from a 200ft away.
    Weaving Silk is very difficult and prone to error, but if you manage to
    Weave something, the effects can be terrifying.

    Talents are straight bonus to individual Actions your Character performs.
    As all Actions are not pre-defined (for example Pick Lock and Use Lockpick
    are two seperate Actions with almost identical results), you need to be
    judicious with how you describe your Talents.

HAUL
----
5 + BRAWN 
---------
    
    Your Haul is a measure of how much equipment, food and other items you can
    manage at once without restricting your Avatar's movement. What you carry in
    your Haul is seperate from how much mass your Character can actually move
    around with force, which is done using the Displace Action, or Carrying it.
    Items that you Carry or otherwise carry in your Haul are eligible to be used
    for an Action readily.

    Instead of worrying about the weight, dimensions and storability of an item,
    your GM roll all these factors into 1 measurement and assigns something a
    Burden to reflect these things. Things can be assigned any amount of Burden,
    but must be given in increments of 1 Burden. Items can have less than 1
    Burden, but they are denoted simply as ~~. You can't put items with less
    than 1 Burden into your Haul. 

    Things with less than 1 Burden can be arbitrarily rolled into Kits. The
    Burden of Kits is determined by your GM, but again, can only be positive
    natural numbers. Kits may stowed in your Haul as normal. There's a whole
    slew of Items and Kits in the Items Manifest, but just for a general sense
    of scale, a combat shotgun is 1 Burden, a rocket launcher is 3, and an adult
    human body is 6.

    Slots are the divisions within your Haul that you can stow items. Items
    placed into Slots are considered to stowed away somewhere on your person or
    otherwise straddled to your body. Items take up an equivalent amount of
    Slots as their Burden when stowed into your Haul. Everything in your Haul
    is considered to be Concealed, and any attempt to see them Checks your Brain
    Core, or the Brain Core of whichever Creatur set your Haul.

    Until you pull something out of a Slot, your Slots are referred to as Super
    Slots. Super Slots can be linked to anything within immediate reach of your
    Avatar while they are Taking a Break or Resting. Anything linked to a Super
    Slot is eligible to be pulled through it, despite the apparent distance
    between where you last left the object and your Haul. This link is broken if
    the item that was linked to a Super Slot is moved or is directly observed by
    another Creature that wishes to break the link. You must still respect the
    Burden of the items, i.e. if you're pulling a 2 Burden item, you need 2
    Super Slots to do so.

    Once you pull something through a Slot, it turns into a Filled Slot. Filled
    Slots cannot be used to store additional items, they merely hold the item
    close at hand. Pulling something through a Super Slot costs can Action and
    breaks the link other Creatures may have formed with the item.

    Empty Slots are any Slots you designate as such. Empty Slots contain no
    items, but can be turned into Filled Slots by simply placing a Burden into
    them. Super Slots can be turned into Empty Slots at will, but the reverse is
    not true.


SWAGGER
-------
5 + SPEED
---------
    
    Swagger is a measure of how graceful and lucky you can be while in High
    Stress Scenarios. You may exchange 1 Swagger to Hustle. When you
    Hustle, you add another card to your Options. This Card can be used as
    normal, but you can't Hustle more than 3 times in a round.

    Items can supply Swagger beyond what is available to you through your Cores,
    but you can't have more than 15 Swagger.

    You recover half your missing Swagger per hour of Break, and recover it
    fully during Rest, plus 1 additional Swagger per 3 Swagger you have
    naturally. Bonus Swagger is not counted towards the 15 Swagger maximum, but
    is used just the same.

GRIT 
----
5 + HEART
---------

    Grit is a measure of how much will you can exert over your emotions and your
    body. When utilizing a Core, you may exchange 1 Grit for +5 Fortune. The
    other rules for generating Fortune, such as Flopping and Doubling or
    Tripling Down apply as normal.

    Items can supply Grit beyond what is available to you through your Cores,
    but you can't have more than 15 Grit.

    You recover half your missing Grit per hour of Break, and recover it fully
    during Rest, plus 1 Bonus Grit per 3 Grit you have naturally. Bonus Grit
    is not counted towards the 15 Grit maximum, but is used just the same.
