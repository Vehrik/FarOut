VITALS
======

Every Character has Vitals. Vitals are statistics generated from the Core Stats.
As you will see, they embody certain aspects of your Character that change how
they interact with the Game World. Among other things, Vitals determine how much
damage your Character can sustain, how difficult it is to damage them in the
first place and how much they can lift.

SKILL
-----
5 + BRAIN
---------

    Skill is a measure of how many things your Character is particular good at.
    Skill manifests in 3 forms. These forms are Knowledge, Mastery and Sense.
    Each has different uses and benefit from Skill slightly differently.

    ###KNOWLEDGE
        
        The amount of applicable information your Avatar obtained prior to their
        Awakening is summized by their Knowledge. When you gain a point of
        Knowledge you may grant your Character a Profession. A Profession is any
        two worded description of a type of job your Character would be well
        suited for. They may have performed this job in the past, but not
        implciitely so.

        For example, you may say your Character has Profession of Car Mechanic.
        This will make them Bang whenever they have to perform a Brain Check/Try
        against any Challenge revolving around indentifying the type of car,
        troubleshooting car malfunctions, or even just general tool use. 

        Some Professions won't quite fit the two-word rule, and a GM may allow
        you to take on a Profession despite it not fitting the above. For
        example, the Astrophysicist Profession does not technically fit the
        two-word rule, but it is still specific enough that it honours the
        spirit of the rule.


    ###MASTERY
        
        Your Character has access to special abilities through Blitz and
        Weave. Both of these refer to intricate mechanics that deserve their own
        section, but in summary Blitz is martial prowess that allows you to
        empower your physical attacks, whereas Weave enables you to interact
        with the Silk in order to direct energy transferance over great
        distances.

    ###SENSE

        Your ability to perceive the world is summarized into 4 Senses:

            Sight
            Hearing
            Touch
            Taste

        Each Sense is set to 0 by default, but you may exchange Sense Points to
        increase 1 Sense. Whenever you Try to Sense something, you use the
        appropriate Sense Score in place of any of your Cores. Whenever you
        bolster a Sense with Sense Points, you may optionally choose to subtract
        1 point from another Sense and add an additional point to the bolstered
        Sense.

        Alternatively, you may expend Sense Points for Sense Augmentations.
        Sense Augmentation are explicite mechanics that allow you perceive the
        world in new ways. This includes things like Echolocation, Nightvision
        and Tremor Sense. For a full list of all the available Sense
        Augmentations, please refer to the Exploration and Intigration portion
        of this document.

        Similar to Cores, Senses can be set to a value between and including -5
        and +5, and can be Dimmed and Glowing. Instead of becoming Broken,
        Senses are merely disabled if they accrue enough penalties that they
        would normally be set to a value of -10. Senses can be Supercharged, but
        there are no secondary effects associated with having a Supercharged
        Sense.


HAUL
----
10 + BRAWN 
----------
    
    Your Haul is a measure of how much equipment, food and other items you can
    manage at once without restricting your Avatar's movement. What you carry in
    your Haul is seperate from how much mass your Character can actually move
    around with force, which is done using the Displace Action, or Carrying it.
    Items that you Carry or otherwise carry in your Haul are eligible to be used
    for an Action readily.

    Instead of worrying about the weight, dimensions and storability of an item,
    your GM roll all these factors into 1 measurement and assigns something a
    Burden to reflect these things. Things can be assigned any amount of Burden,
    but must be given in increments of 1 Burden.

    A portion of your Haul, called Slots, may either be Super, Empty or Filled.

    Empty Slots are merely Empty, and can be filled with a Burden that you find
    during your travels. 

    Filled Slots are merely occupied by an object with at least 1 Burden. Once a
    Slot is Filled, it can't hold anything else unless you deliberately Empty it
    and drop the object that was being held in the Filled Slot. Emptying a
    single Slot can be done as a Bonus Action, but Emptying more than one Slot
    at a time requires an Action.

    Super Slots are Slots that are considered to be Filled, but don't hold a
    particular object. During your adventures, you will undoubtly come across
    situations where you didn't bring the right tool for the job. In instances
    like this, you may expend Super Slots to hand-wave away the fact that you
    didn't explicitely pack an item. This process is called Plucking. Plucked
    items must be generic and mundane, or otherwise you must possessed and
    secured or have been lent the object your Plucking. 

    Circumstances may make certain items ineligble for Plucking. For example, if
    you pass a security check-point, you wouldn't then be able to then Pluck a
    machine gun as soon as you reach the other side. Circumstances may make you
    unable to Pluck almost anything at all, for example if you get stranded on a
    barren moon and were only left with a week's worth of rations and the
    space-suit on your back.

    If your Haul is plundered, the thief is able to Pluck items through any
    Super Slots you might have.

SWAGGER
-------
5 + SPEED
---------
    
    Swagger is a measure of how graceful and lucky you can be while in High
    Stress Scenarios. You may exchange 1 Swagger to Hustle. When you
    Hustle, you add another card to your Options. This Card can be used as
    normal, but you can't Hustle more than 3 times in a round.

    Items can supply Swagger beyond what is available to you through your Cores,
    but you can't have more than 15 Swagger.

    You recover half your missing Swagger per hour of Break, and recover it
    fully during Rest, plus 1 additional Swagger per 3 Swagger you have
    naturally. Bonus Swagger is not counted towards the 15 Swagger maximum, but
    is used just the same.

GRIT 
----
5 + HEART
---------

    Grit is a measure of how much will you can exert over your emotions and your
    body. When utilizing a Core, you may exchange 1 Grit for +5 Fortune OR -5
    Fortune. The other rules for generating Fortune, such as Flopping and
    Doubling or Tripling Down apply as normal.

    Items can supply Grit beyond what is available to you through your Cores,
    but you can't have more than 15 Grit.

    You recover half your missing Grit per hour of Break, and recover it fully
    during Rest, plus 1 Bonus Grit per 3 Grit you have naturally. Bonus Grit
    is not counted towards the 15 Grit maximum, but is used just the same.
