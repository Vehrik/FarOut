The Haze permeates the World, turning both conscious and unconscious thoughts into
reality. Personality manifests as mutations, culture begets entire species. The Human
Race has fractured into dozens of different species, and even within these loosely
defined species, you have your freaks and outcasts.

There are three main aspects of your physiology that you must consider. They are
your:

        SIZE
        PERCEPTION
        HUNGER

SIZE
====
Being a 12ft 6000lb giant is great when you're in the thick of battle or trying to
make a guard piss his pants out of fear, but it may render you physically incapable
of entering certain areas. You shoud also carefully consider the logistics of keeping
your Character fed. Similarly, being the size of a mouse would make it extremely
difficult to initimidate anyone, but makes skulking around almost natural.

The Size Categories are as followings, all with different benefits, penalties and dimensions:

your Character's Size to either Small, Medium or Big. If you wish to take on the
characteristics of the more extreme Size Categories, you must purchase a Resize as
outlined in the Traits section.

As you have read, each category offers variations on the following:

    Brawn Maximum
    Speed Maximum
    Momentum
    Natj
