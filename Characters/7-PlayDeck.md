Challenges
==========

Every time your Character attempts to do something outside the realm of mundane
life, be it climbing a ladder, diving over moving vehicles, or feinting a
sword swipe, your GM will ask you to beat a Challenge of proportional
Difficulty based on what it is depending what you're doing.

This is known as a Challenge, and the Player/Character response to it is
referred to as an Attempt. In order to Attempt a Challenge, the GM first
determines which Core of the Character is being challenged. Almost always this
is easily decided, but occasionally 

In order to properly utilize the Play Deck, you must grasp the following
concepts:

    Cores & Challenges
    Doubling Down, Tripling Down and Flopping.
    Bangs, Busts, and Boons

The Play Deck is a standard deck of playing cards. It contains 54 Cards in
total, 2 Jokers (1 Red and 1 Black) plus 13 each of 4 Suits (Clubs, Spades,
Hearts, Diamonds). 

Half the Suits are Red (Hearts and Diamonds) and half are Black (Clubs and
Spades). Each Card Suit corresponds with one of the 4 Character Cores. Each player and
the GM needs their own personal Play Deck. 

Ideally, they are high-quality, durable playing cards with the Suits
distinguished by both colour and symbol, but low-budget decks can be made out of
readily available materials in a pinch.

When you attempt a Challenge, you draw the top card from your Play Deck. The value
on the card (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack(11), Queen(12), King(13), Ace(11//1),
Joker(15//0)) is added to the value of the corresponding Core of your Character.

Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 11, 12, and 13 respectively. 

If you draw an Ace, if it is of the correct colour, it is equivalent to 14, but if
it is the wrong colour, it is equivalent to a 1. 

If you draw a Joker, if it is the wrong colour, it is worth 0, and you
automatically Bust for your next Action, but if it is the correct colour, it is
worth 15, and you automatically Bang during your next Action. A colour is
"correct" if you are using the colour of its associated Core (Black for Speed
and Brawn, Red for Brain and Heart).

As discussed in the Cores and Capacities Section, when your Character is faced
with a Challenge, you combine the Card's face value with the Challenges
associated Core.

This number is your Attempt Score. Having an Attempt Score greater than or equal
to the Challenge's Difficulty results in an increasing degree of success. Falling
short results in failure, with increasingly severe punishments the more points
you fail by.

Exactly what happens when resolving a Challenge is up to your GM's
interpretation of the Context and what your Attempt Score ends up being.

The GM is at sole discretion to determine the value of a Challenge's Difficulty,
but the following chart should loosely guide their decisions:


1>>5 -> Mundane

        These are actions that most humans encounter at least once or twice a day
        that are still easily failed if you aren't paying attention. They would
        include running up a staircase, driving to work, or cooking a decent meal.

5>>9 -> Average

        These actions refer to those that average humans are capable of,
        especially if properly motivated. This includes doing your taxes, riding
        a bike, or putting together an impressive slideshow. 

10>>14 -> Above Average

        These actions refer to those that humans can only typically do
        consistently if they've practiced them. These actions aren't record
        setting, but most humans are not automatically capable of them without
        at least some effort. This includes ramming down a thick wooden door,
        climbing a mountain, or participating in a varsity chess tournament.

15>>19 -> Champion
        
        These actions refer to those that only highly talented humans are
        capable of doing consistently, but that are still able to be
        completed by average humans with a good deal of luck, preperation
        and/or stubborness. This includes walking across a thin wooden beam
        in a storm, fighting off a shark, or acing a college midterm.

20>>24 -> Hero

        These actions are extremely impressive ones that are beyond the realm
        of what the human anatomy is physically capable of. This includes things
        like bench-pressing cars, running across water like it were solid
        ground, or cracking an encrypted computer cypher. 

25 -> Super Hero 

        This is the very highest ability Characters are intended to reach without the
        assistance of sophisticated military hardware. Actions of this type include
        throwing cars like they're stones, running through buildings like they aren't
        even there, or cracking out massive turn-night-into-day lightning bolts.

DOUBLING DOWN, TRIPLING DOWN, & FLOPPING
----------------------------------------

There will be times where you just can't afford to fail a particular Challenge,
but the card you draw is not the one you think you need. In an instance like this, you can
do one of two things:

    1. Pray that the GM will take mercy on you.

    2. Double Down
    
Doubling Down means that you can draw one more Card and add its value to
whatever your Attempt Score was initially. So for example, you want your
Character to catch the arm of a falling comrade, but you draw an 8, but you have
a -1 Speed Core. You're fairly positive that an Attempt of 7 isn't going to be
enough, so you declare you're Doubling Down. You then draw another Card, a 6 in
this case, which brings the Attempt up to 13, which *should* be enough. Doubling
Down consumes an Action when you declare that you're doing it.

Tripling Down is just Doubling Down on a Double Down. So in the previous
example, you drew a 2 instead of a 6. You want something higher than a 9, so you
take the risk and Triple Down. You then draw another Card and add that value to
the card drawn when you Doubled Down AND the card you initially drew when you
took the first Action as well as your relevant Core. Say you drew a 4 when you
Doubled Down, then a 3 when you Tripled Down, you would end up with a total
Attempt of 14. Tripling Down consumes another Action when you declare you're
doing so.

You must decide to Double Down or Triple Down *before* your GM reveals whether
or not your Attempt succeeded or not.

Be careful, because in addition to the lost Actions, you can Flop. If the total
of the 3 Cards you drew is higher than 15, your Attempt Score is set to 1 + the
relevant Core. In other words, you are treated as if you *only* drew an Ace of
the wrong colour for your Action. 

If you draw a Joker that's the wrong Colour when you Double or Triple Down, you
automatically Flop in addition to incurring the normal effects of drawing a bad
Joker.


BANGS & BUSTS
-------------

Multiple things are able to increase your Cores and enable you to overcome
harder and harder challenges. One of these things are Narrative components of
the Game World.  Depending on your Character's anatomy, backstory, and
situation, they may be disadvantaged or advantaged in dealing with certain
Challenges.

If you are in an advantageous position when Attempting a Challenge, instead of
drawing 1 Card from the Play Deck, you draw 2 cards and choose the card with the
higher value for your given Challenge. The GM alone has the permission to grant
a Bang, but some mechanics explicitly grant one.

If you are in an disadvantageous position when Attempting a Challenge, instead
of drawing 1 Card from the play deck, you draw 2 cards and choose the worse
card, placing the better card at the bottom of the Play Deck. This type of
situation is called a Bust. The GM alone has the permission to hand down a Bust,
but some mechanics explicitly incur one.

GRUNTING
--------

Grunting means that your Character pushed their body to its limits for a
short amount of time in order to gain the upper-hand in a situation.
Grunting costs Stamina, and can be used to generate one of the following
effects:

    1. Reach For It - 1 Stamina - You were Busted for this Action, but you
       nullify the effects of it at the cost of 1 Stamina, treating the Action
       as if it were normal.

    2. Fast Reaction - 1 Stamina - Reactions are usually resolved in the time
       between the gun firing and the bullet hitting, but a Fast Reaction is
       resolved before the gun even fires. When you declare that you are
       Reacting to something, you may also declare that you are performing a
       Fast Reaction and expend the 1 point of Stamina.

    3. Heartseeker - 2 Stamina - You may expend 2 points of Stamina in order to
       take 1 Action with a Bang. You must utilize this empowered Action
       immediately after you expend the Stamina.

    4. Swing By The Bootstraps - 2 Stamina - After you fail a Challenge, you may
       decide to expend 2 points of Stamina in order to retry the Challenge. If
       you succeed this time, you were treated as you succeeded for the initial
       Attempt.
       
    5. Frenzy - 2 Stamina - After you have used up all 3 Actions for a Round,
       you may expend Stamina in order to gain 1 additional Action for the
       Round. You may only do this once per Round.

GETTING STAGGERED
-----------------

It's often tempting to throw all your Actions out at once to make something go
splat, but you need to be judicious with your Actions. During High Stress
Scenarios (usually this means a combat scenario, but can include things chasing
a bounty across rooftops, or zipping between buildings at Mach V), you have 3
Actions per round. These Actions can be triggered proactively in response to the
Actions of other Creatures, and when this is the case they are called Reactions.
Both Reactions and Actions count as one of your 3 Actions. 

Being on the receiving end of a hostile Action can force you to Attempt a
Challenge, and in cases where you have used up all 3 Actions for the Round, you
are considered to be Staggered. When Staggered, all Challenge that you are
forced to complete you make are made with a Bust. 

BOONS
-----

As a reward for playing the game well, a GM may grant you a Boon. A
Boon can do one of three things:

            1. Grant your Character a Bang on their next Action.

            2. Nullify the effects of a Bust.

            3. Be gifted to another player. Doing so costs an Action from the
               Character who is gifting the Boon.

What is meant by "playing the game well" is really up to the GM, but typically
it would include things like reacting compellingly to situations, remaining in
Character consistently, abiding by the Virtues and Vices of your Character, or
otherwise improving the play experience for everyone (including the GM!). This
list is by no means exhaustive, and a GM is free to hand out Boons as they see
fit.

A Player can only be in possession of a single Boon at a time.
