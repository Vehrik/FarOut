DODGE

    When you are targetted by an Attack, Trait, or any hazardous force, you may
    use a Reaction to Dodge. When you Dodge, you Attempt a Speed Challenge
    against the Difficulty of the hazardous Challenge. If your Attempt for the
    Dodge is higher than the Difficulty of the hazardous Challenge, you are
    considered to have avoided the hazard entirely and suffer none of its
    effects. 

    If the Challenge was a part of an Attack that had AoE, you must also have
    enough Dash to exit its Area, otherwise you take half damage instead.
