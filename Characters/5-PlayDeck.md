Challenges
==========

Everytime your Character attempts do something outside the realm of mundane
life, be it climbing a ladder, diving over moving vehicles, or feinting a
sword swipe, your GM will ask you to beat a Challenge of proportional
Difficulty based on what it is depending what you're doing.

In order to complete a Challenge, you must become familiar with three things:

    The Play Deck
    Cores & Challenges
    Bangs, Busts, and Boons

The Play Deck is a physical deck of of playing cards. It contains 54 Cards in
total, 2 Jokers (1 Red and 1 Black) plus 13 each of 4 Suits (Clubs, Spades,
Hearts, Diamonds). 

Half the Suits are Red (Hearts and Diamonds) and half are Black (Clubs and
Spades). Each Card Suit corresponds with one of the 4 Character Cores. Each player and
the GM needs their own personal Play Deck. 

Ideally, they are high-quality, durable playing cards with Suits
distinguished by colour, but low-budget decks can be made out of readily
available materials in a pinch.

When you attempt a Challenge, you draw the top card from your Play Deck. The value
on the card (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack(11), Queen(12), King(13), Ace(11//1),
Joker(15//0)) is added to the value of the corresponding Core of your Character.

If you draw an Ace, if it is of the correct colour, it is equivalent to 14, but if
it is the wrong colour, it is equivalent to a 1. If you draw a Joker, if it is the
wrong colour, it is worth 0, and you automatically Bust during your next turn, but
if it is the right colour, it is worth 15, and you automatically Bang during your
next turn. A colour is "correct" if you are using the colour of its associated
Core (Black for Speed and Brawn, Red for Brain and Heart)

As discussed in the Core Section, when your Character is faced with a Challenge,
you combine the Card's face value with the Challenges associated Core.

This number is your Attempt Score. The having an Attempt be greater than or equal
to the Challenge's Difficulty results in an increasing degree of success. Falling
short results in failure, with increasesingly severe punishments the more points
you fail by.

The GM is at sole discretion to determine the value of a Challenge's Difficulty,
but the following chart should guide their decisions:

   <5  -> Mundane

           These are actions that most humans encounter at least once or twice a day
           that are still easily failed if you aren't paying attention. They would
           include running up a staircase, driving to work, or cooking a decent meal.

   5   -> Average

           These actions refer to those that average humans are capable of,
           especially if properly motivated. This includes doing your taxes,
           beginner level skateboard tricks, or putting together an impressive
           slideshow. 

   10   -> Above Average

           These actions refer to those that humans can only typically do
           consistently if they've practiced them. These actions aren't record
           setting, but most humans are not automatically capable of them
           without at least some effort.  This includes ramming down a wooden
           door, climbing a mountain, or participating in a varsity chess
           tournament.

   15   -> Champion
           
           These actions refer to those that only highly talented humans are
           capable of doing consistently, but that are still able to be
           completed by average humans with a good deal of luck, preperation
           and/or stubborness. This includes walking across a thin wooden beam
           in a storm, fighting off a shark, or successfully completing a PhD.

   20   -> Hero

           These actions are extremely impressive ones that are beyond the realm
           of the human anatomy is physically capable of. This includes things
           like bench-pressing cars, running across water like it were solid
           ground, or cracking an encrypted computer cypher. 

   25   -> Super Hero 

           This is the very highest ability Characters are intended to reach without the
           assistance of sophisticated military hardware. Actions of this type include
           throwing cars like they're stones, running through buildings like they aren't
           even there, or cracking out massive turn-night-into-day lightning bolts across
           the sky.


BANGS, BUSTS, & BOONS
=====================

Multiple things are able to increase your Cores and enable you to overcome
harder and harder challenges. One of these things are Narrative components of
the Game World.  Depending on your Character's anatomy, backstory, and
situation, they may be disadvantaged or advantaged in dealing with certain
Challenges.

If you are in an advantageous position when Attempting a Challenge, instead of
drawing 1 Card from the Play Deck, you draw 2 cards and choose the card with the
higher value for your given Challenge. After picking your Card, you place the
unchosen card at the bottom of the Play Deck, and the used card into the Open
Chakra. This type of situation is called a Bang. The GM alone has the permission
to grant a Bang, but some mechanics explicitely grant one.

If you are in an disadvantageous position when Attempting a Challenge, instead
of drawing 1 Card from the play deck, you draw 2 cards and choose the worse
card, placing the unchosen card at the bottom of the Play Deck, and placing the
chosen card into your Open Chakra. This type of situation is called a Bust. The
GM alone has the permission to hand down a Bust, but some mechanics explicitely
incur one.

Finally, as a reward for playing the game well, a GM may grant you a Boon. A
Boon can do one of three things:

            1. Grant your Character a Bang on their next Action.

            2. Nullify the effects of a Bust.

            3. Be gifted to another player. Doing so costs an Action from the
               Character who is gifting the Boon.

What is meant by playing the game "well" is really up to the GM, but typically
it would include things like playing your Character compellingly, remaining in
Character consistently or otherwise avoiding "Table Talk", abiding by the
Virtues and Flaws of your Character, or otherwise improving the play experience
for everyone (including the GM!).
