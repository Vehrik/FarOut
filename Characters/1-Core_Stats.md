CORE STATS
==========

Your Cores are the ranking of your Character's mental and physical
attributes. They influence every Action your Character takes and helps the
GM decide whether your Character will succeed or fail Challenges and to what
extent. Choose your stats wisely, there are plenty of items/environmental
hazards that impart a "minimum requirement" for a certain Core. 

You can't be amazing at everything. Often times, achieving a higher Core
Value means making sacrifices, sometimes that could literally be an arm and
a leg. In a society where all but the most destitute and far-flung have been
genetically engineered so they are at the peak of what the human physiology
is capable of, the only way to gain meaningful advantages is to specialize.

Below each Stat is described for what facets of a creature it represents.
These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, and with clever
role-playing you can 'force' your GM to allow you to utilize a Core for
something it wouldn't normally be used for.

BRAWN
-----

    Brawn is a measure of your character's physical hardiness, physique and raw
    brute strength. Having a higher Brawn score allows your Character to dish
    out hard punches, take harder hits, and shoulder heavy burdens. Brawn also
    determines your Accuracy and Damage with Crude Weapons and Unarmed Attacks.

SPEED
-----
    
    Speed is a measure of how accurately and quickly your Character can move
    between and through obstacles. Having a higher Speed score indicates your
    character is fast moving, acrobatic and in possession of quick reflexes.
    Speed also determines your accuracy with Ranged and Technical weapons.

BRAIN
-----

    Brain is a measure of your character's mental processing power, memory,
    perception, and precise, methodical movements like lock-picking and
    stitching up wounds. A character with a high Brain score can retain more
    Protocols and are typically in possession of a large bank of trivial
    knowledge. Brain also determines your ability to Weave Silk
    

HEART
-----

    Heart is a measure of your character's strength of character, will,
    instinct, emotion, and confidence. Your ability to resist and impose mental
    effects, ignore exhaustion and tolerate pain is determined by your Heart
    Core.


CAPACITIES & STRESS
===================

    You have two Capacities, Body and Soul. Brawn and Speed belong to the Body
    Capacity and Brain and Heart belong to the Soul Capacity.

    Every Core can have a score from -5 to +5 without the help of items,
    mutations, or technology. However, raising one Core implicitely lowers
    another. A score of 0 indicates that your Character is in possession of
    skills that are at the biological peak of humanity.

    Because of this, your Capacities are best thought of as a finite resource
    that you must dole out amongst the Cores, favouring one Core means harming the
    other associated Core as it implies your Creature has made its anatomy more
    specialized in some way.

    For example, if you had a +3 Brawn Core, it would implicitely cause your
    Speed Core to be set at -3. Having a negative score in a Core is not
    automatically "bad", it merely means that the Creature has a anatomy that is
    highly specialized. A Creature wouldn't be able to be called "inept" at
    certain tasks until the Associated Core dipped below -3.
    
    With this in mind, you are given 3 Slant at Character Creation, which you
    may apply to your Cores in one of two directions. Using Slant for Core
    Enhancement is not required. Your Cores and Capacities are represented
    visually below:

STRESS
-----

      Each Capacity is also subject to a penalty called Stress. Stress ranges
      from 0 to 10. You accumulate Stress by sustaining injuries, starving,
      suffering from intense psychological effects, or coming into contact with
      certain environmental Hazards or from your Character pushing themselves
      briefly beyond their limits. Stress applies to both your Body and Soul
      simultaneously.

      Stress is relieved by having your Character take a Break, eating food, and
      by tending to minor injuries that occur during adventures. Sometimes, the
      Stress becomes semi-permenant, such as when you take severe Injury.

      When a Creature accumulates Stress, it lowers the effective score of the
      Capacity, and can even make a Core unusuable. If a Creature accumulates 15
      Stress, they fall unconscious and becomes vulnerable to Execution.

      Stress does not effect your vitals, but there are consequences associated
      with Cores dropping to negative values. You accumulate these penalties
      whether your Core is naturally below certain values, or is lowered by Stress

      The consequences for having low Core Stats are as follows:

        Brawn 

            <= -3 Weakened

                            Your Character is treated as if they had no Brawn
                            for purposes of determing how much Burden they can
                            bare. 

            == -5 Enfeebled


                            Your Character automatically fails all Brawn
                            Challenges. It is also treated as if
                            it only had 1 Momentum when determing how much
                            Burden they can bare.

        Speed

            <= -3 Hobbled

                            Your Character's is only able to Dash if they expend
                            an Action. They also Busts when Attempting Movement
                            and their Stride is also set to 1::1.

            == -5 Crippled

                            Your Character is unable to move more than 5ft per
                            round, and doing so consumes both Actons they have.
                            They also fail any Speed Challenges encountered.

        Brain

            <= -3 Foggy
                            Your Creature loses all Talents other than those
                            supplied by their Natural Talent until they stop
                            being Foggy. In addition, all Brain related
                            Challenges are made with a Bust.

            == -5 Gobsmacked

                            Your Character automatically fails all Brain related
                            Challenges. They are also considered to be Busted
                            for every other Action. 

        Heart

            <= -3 Disheartened  

                            Your Character loses the ability to Grunt except for
                            when they Grit Their Teeth. Breaks only restore 1
                            Stamina per 2 Hours.

            == -5 Enthralled

                            The Character loses their free will, meaning they
                            can't take Actions. Reactions may be taken as
                            normal. 

                            Other Creatures can make 2-worded commands that may
                            or may not be paired with a gesture as an Action.
                            The Enthralled Creature fulfills all commands given
                            to them in good faith, but Enthralled Creatures
                            cannot be made to directly cause Damage to
                            themselves or their Friends, but can't be made to
                            cause Damage the Creature they're Enthralled to or
                            the Friends of that Creature either. 

                            They obey the instructions of Friends over those
                            issued by Strangers, and obey the instructions of
                            Strangers over those issues by Foes. 

                            If a Foe issues instructions in the presence of
                            Friends, the Enthralled Creature will check for
                            disapproval from their Friends before they carry out
                            the instructions. Voicing disapproval costs 1
                            Action. If no Friend voices disapproval, then the
                            Creature follows the command if it satisfies the
                            above criteria.

                            Enthralled Creatures consider other Enthralled
                            Creatures as Strangers. If no Friends are present,
                            you treat Foes as if they were Friends.

                            Enthralled Creatures snap out of it if their Heart
                            Core is raised above -4.
