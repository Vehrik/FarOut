CORE STATS
==========

Your Cores are the ranking of your Character's mental and physical
attributes. They influence every Action your Character takes and helps the
GM decide whether your Character will succeed or fail Challenges and to what
extent. Choose your stats wisely, there are plenty of items/environmental
hazards that impart a "minimum requirement" for a certain Core. 

You can't be amazing at everything. Often times, achieving a higher Core
Value means making sacrifices, sometimes that could literally be an arm and
a leg. In a society where all but the most destitute and far-flung have been
genetically engineered so they are at the peak of what the human physiology
is capable of, the only way to gain meaningful advantages is to specialize.

Below each Stat is described for what facets of a creature it represents.
These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, and with clever
role-playing you can 'force' your GM to allow you to utilize a Core for
something it wouldn't normally be used for.

BRAWN
-----

    Brawn is a measure of your character's physical hardiness, physique and raw
    brute strength. Having a higher Brawn score allows your Character to dish
    out hard punches, take harder hits, and shoulder heavy burdens. Brawn also
    determines your Accuracy and Damage with Crude Weapons and Unarmed Attacks.

SPEED
-----
    
    Speed is a measure of how accurately and quickly your Character can move
    between and through obstacles. Having a higher Speed score indicates your
    character is fast moving, acrobatic and in possession of quick reflexes.
    Speed also determines your accuracy with Ranged and Technical weapons.

BRAIN
-----

    Brain is a measure of your character's mental processing power, memory,
    perception, and precise, methodical movements like lock-picking and
    stitching up wounds. A character with a high Brain score can retain more
    Protocols and are typically in possession of a large bank of trivial
    knowledge. Brain also determines your ability to Weave Silk
    

HEART
-----

    Heart is a measure of your character's strength of character, will,
    instinct, emotion, and confidence. Your ability to resist and impose mental
    effects, ignore exhaustion and tolerate pain is determined by your Heart
    Core.


ASPECTS & STRESS
===================

    You have two Aspects, Body and Soul. Brawn and Speed belong to the Body
    Aspect and Brain and Heart belong to the Soul Aspect.

    Every Core can have a score from -5 to +5 without the help of items,
    mutations, or technology. A score of 0 indicates that your Character is in
    possession of skills that are at the biological peak of humanity, whereas a
    score of +5 indicates that a Creature has a body specifically engineered to
    bring them to a level of ability more on par with modern industrial
    equipment. Average, mundane humanity would be at around -3, with
    incompetence or severe disability is indicated by a score of -5.

    Something that's very important to keep in mind that raising one's Natural
    Cores implicitely lowers another. Because of this, your Aspects are best
    thought of as a finite resource that you must dole out amongst the Cores,
    favouring one Core means harming the other associated Core as it implies
    your Creature has made its anatomy more specialized in some way.

    For example, if you had a +3 Brawn Core, it would implicitely cause your
    Speed Core to be set at -3. Having a negative score in a Core is not
    automatically "bad", it merely means that the Creature has a anatomy that is
    highly specialized. A Creature wouldn't be able to be called "inept" at
    certain tasks until the Associated Core dipped below -3.

    There are ways to raise Cores without lowering another, but these methods
    are always temporary and typically have penalties associated with them.

    Cores can be raised or lowered to a point where they become Heightened, or
    Diminished. Cores become Heightened when they reach a value of +3 or more.
    When this happens, you always Bang while using that Core in order to Attempt
    Challenges. Cores become Diminished when they reach a value of -3 or less.
    Then this happens, you always Bust while using that Core to Attempt
    Challenges. Diminished Cores also cause additional penalties.
    
    With this in mind, you are given 3 Slant at Character Creation, which you
    may apply to your Cores in one of two directions. Using Slant for Core
    Enhancement is not required, however you should keep in mind that if a Core
    has 3 or higher, it is considered Hightened and leads to your Character
    Banging every time they use it. Contrastringly, if a Core is -3 or lower, it
    is considered Deminished, and causes your Character to Bust every time they
    utilize it.

BREAKING HEARTS AND GOING REALLY FAST
-------------------------------------

Even though Cores can only be set at a value between -5 and +5, they can
temporarily be pushed past these two values. Cores cannot be set to a value
beyond -5 or +5, but they can be Broken or Super Charged. 

### BROKEN CORES

    If a Core suffers from enough penalties that it would normally be set to a
    value lower than -5, you instead count if as Broken. When a Core is Broken,
    instead of drawing 1 Cards from the Play Deck per Action, you draw 2, then
    choose the worse Card. 

### SUPER CHARGED CORES

    If a Core benefits from enough bonuses that it would normally be set to a
    value higher than +5, you instead count if as Super Charged. When a Core is
    Super Charged, instead of drawing 1 Cards from the Play Deck per Action, you
    draw 2, then choose the the higher valued Card. 

### STRESS

    Each Aspect is also subject to a penalty called Stress. Stress ranges from 0
    to 20. You accumulate Stress by sustaining injuries, starving, suffering
    from intense psychological effects, or coming into contact with certain
    environmental Hazards or from your Character pushing themselves briefly
    beyond their limits. Stress can be either Physical or Mental. Physical
    Stress lowers your Brawn and Speed Cores, whereas Mental Stress lowers
    your Heart and Brain Cores. 

    Stress is relieved by having your Character take a Break, eat food, and
    mend Injuries.

    When a Creature accumulates Stress, it lowers the effective score of the
    Stressed Cores, and can Break Cores. If all Cores are Broken, the
    Character falls unconscious and becomes vulnerable to Execution.  

    Stress does not effect your vitals, but there are consequences associated
    with Cores dropping to negative values. You accumulate these penalties
    whether your Core is naturally below certain values, or is lowered by Stress
    
    Brawn

    .= Weakened

            The Stamina required to perform Grunts is doubled. 

    // Enfeebled

            Enfeebled Creatures must expend an Action at the beginning of their
            Turn in order to remain upright. If they don't use an Action to do
            so, they fall Prone. They must spend an Action similarly when they
            stand up from being Prone. All Brawn related Challenges are failed
            automatically.

    Speed

    .= Hobbled 

            Your Character's is only able to Dash if they expend an Action.
  
    // Crippled

            Your Character loses the ability to Dash entirely and fails all
            Speed based Challenges automatically. 

    Brain

    .= -3 Foggy

            While Foggy, your Creature loses all Talents other than those
            supplied by their Natural Talent as well as the ability to Weave
            Silk if they previously possessed it. 
 
    // Gobsmacked

            Your Character automatically fails all Brain related Challenges
            except those to do with their senses. They also become unable to
            speak, read or comprehend spoken words. 

            The Creature can't benefit from any Talents they have. 

            Creatures who were born with a -5 Brain Core can only learn how to
            speak and read if they raise their Brain Core to 0.

    Heart

        <= -3 Disheartened  

            Disheartened Creatures doubled the amount of Stress they take on.
            This bonus Stress is refered to as Despair, and is dropped when a
            Creature stops being Disheartened.

         /= -5 Enthralled

            The Character loses their free will, meaning they can't take Actions
            unless they are acting on behalf of another Creature. Reactions may
            be taken as normal. 

            Other Creatures can make 2-worded commands that may or may not be
            paired with a gesture as an Action. The Enthralled Creature fulfills
            all commands given to them in good faith, but Enthralled Creatures
            cannot be made to directly cause Damage to themselves or their
            Friends, but can't be made to directly Damage the Creature they're
            Enthralled to or the Friends of the Enthralling Creature. 

            Enthralled Creatures obey the instructions of Friends over those
            issued by Strangers, and obey the instructions of Strangers over
            those issues by Foes. 

            If a Foe issues instructions in the presence of Friends, the
            Enthralled Creature will check for disapproval from their Friends
            before they carry out the instructions. Voicing disapproval costs 1
            Action. If no Friend voices disapproval, then the Creature follows
            the command if it satisfies the above criteria. If two Friends issue
            conflicting instructions, the Enthralled Creature follows the
            instructions of the Friend with the highest Heart Core.

            Enthralled Creatures consider other Enthralled Creatures as
            Strangers. If no Friends are present, you treat Foes as if they were
            Friends.

            If the thing that Enthralled a Creature was a Hazard, or some other
            effect such as hunger or thirst, the GM assumes the role as the Foe
            and issues commands on the force's behalf.

            Instructions are followed in a FIFO (First In, First Out) pattern.
            This means that if an Enthralled Creature gets two valid,
            non-conflicting instructions that can't be completed simultaneously,
            they will fulfill the oldest instructions first. Requests can be
            cancelled by the person who issued them.
