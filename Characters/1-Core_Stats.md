CORE STATS
==========

Your Cores are the ranking of your Character's mental and physical
attributes. They influence every Action your Character takes and helps the
GM decide whether your Character will succeed or fail Challenges and to what
extent. Choose your stats wisely, there are plenty of items/environmental
hazards that impart a "minimum requirement" for a certain Core. 

You can't be amazing at everything. Often times, achieving a higher Core
Value means making sacrifices, sometimes that could literally be an arm and
a leg. In a society where all but the most destitute and far-flung have been
genetically engineered so they are at the peak of what the human physiology
is capable of, the only way to gain meaningful advantanges is to specialize.

Below each Stat is described for what facets of a creature it represents.
These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, and with clever
role-playing you can 'force' your GM to allow you to utilize a Core for
something it wouldn't normally be used for.

BRAWN
-----

    Brawn is a measure of your character's physical hardiness, physique and raw
    brute strength. Having a higher Brawn score allows your Character to dish
    out hard punches, take harder hits, and lift heavy burdens. Brawn also
    determines your Accuracy and Damage with Crude Weapons and Unarmed Attacks.

SPEED
-----
    
    Speed is a measure of how accurately and quickly your Character can move
    between and through obstacles. Having a higher Speed score indicates your
    character is fast moving, acrobatic and in possession of quick reflexes.
    Speed also determines your accuracy with Ranged and Technical weapons.

BRAIN
-----

    Brain is a measure of your character's mental processing power, memory,
    perception, and precise, methodical movements like lock-picking and
    stitching up wounds. A character with a high Brain score can retain more
    Protocols and are typically in possession of a large bank of trivial
    knowledge. Brain also determines your Accuracy and Damage with Psionic
    Attacks.

HEART
-----

    Heart is a measure of your character's discipline, will, instinct, and
    confidence. Your ability to resist and impose mental effects, ignore
    exhaustion and tolerate pain is determined by your Heart Core.


CAPACITIES
==========

    You have two Capacities, Body and Soul. Brawn and Speed belong to the Body
    Capacity and Brain and Heart belong to the Soul Capacity.

    Every Core can have a score from -5 to 5 without the help of items, mutations,
    or technology. However, raising one Core implicitely lowers another. A score
    of 0 indicates that your Character is in possession of skills that are at
    the biological peak of humanity.

    Because of this, your Capacities are best thought of as a finite resource
    that you must dole out amongst the Cores, favouring one Core means harming the
    other associated Core as it implies your Creature has made its anatomy more
    specialized in some way.

    For example, if you had a +3 Brawn Core, it would implicitely cause your
    Speed Core to be set at -3. Having a negative score in a Core is not
    automatically "bad", it merely means that the Creature has a anatomy that is
    highly specialized.
    
    With this in mind, you are given 3 Slant at Character Creation, which you
    may apply to your Cores in one of two directions. Using Slant for Core
    Enhancement is not required. Your Cores and Capacities are represented
    visually below:
