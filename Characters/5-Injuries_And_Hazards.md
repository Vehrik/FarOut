INJURIES
========

In instances where a Creature's Armor has failed them, and they've failed to
avoid Damage, they take a direct hit to their body. o

INJURIES I (3+ Health Remaining)
--------------------------------

General Effect: 

Immediately when the Injury is received the Character WINCES, meaning they may
only take 1 Action this round instead of 2. If the Character has already used
both its Actions for this round, the WINCE subtracts an Action from the next
round instead.

### CLUB - TORSO & UPPER LIMBS

#### Laceration (Slashing) / Burn I (Fire)

    You receive a deep cut across either your Charater's body or the upper
    portion on one or several of its limbs that bleeds profusely. For the next
    five rounds, or until the Injury is healed, all Body related Challenges are
    made with a Bust.

#### Through and Through (Piercing / Stabbing) / Chilled To The Bone (Frost)

    You either got winged by a lazer or you got lucky and a blade missed all
    your organs. The Stride of the Creature is immediately reduced by an amount
    equivalent to the Damage of the attack. Then for the next five rounds, or
    until the wound is treated, the Creature's Stride is reduced to its Natural
    Stride or 3, whichever is lower.

#### Blunt Force Trauma (Blunt) / Shocked (Electric)

    You got hit squarely by something with a lot of mass. Your Character
    immediately FLINCHES instead of WINCING due to the General Effect of Level I
    Injuries. In addition, you must preform a Heart Challenge equivalent to the
    Damage of the attack. Failing this Challenge causes your Character to drop
    anything that they were Holding.

#### Toxic Shock (Poison)

### SPADE - LOWER LIMBS

The Damaged Creature draws a Card and reads its value
