INJURIES
========

In instances where a Creature's Armor and Health has failed them, and they've
failed to avoid Damage, they take a direct hit to their body. Most Injuries
incur either Wincing or Flinching. To understand these two things you must
understand Action Debt.

Every Creature is able to perform 3 or 4 Actions/Reactions per each Round.
Action Debt needs to be settled before any Action/Reaction is performed. Action
Debt is repaid by discarding Actions. Action Debt persists between Rounds until
it is paid off.

Wincing incurs an Action Debt of 2, whereas Flinching incurs an Action Debt of
3.

Injuries are categorized by both their intensity(I, II, III), and by which body
part becomes Injured. When resolving Injuries, there are two ways to determine
which body part become is damaged

INJURIES I - Hard Hits
----------------------

General Effect: 

Immediately when the Injury is received the Character WINCES, incurring an
Action Debt of 2. Your max Health is also reduced by 3. This effect is removed
when you have received Class D+ or higher medical assistance, or Patch Up during
a break.

If the body portion that you are about to have Injured houses your Trait,
your GM will draw a 3 Play Cards and you must pick either Black or Red. If
you pick correctly, you may choose whether the Trait or the associated limb
is damaged, but if you chose incorrectly, the GM gets to decide. If you draw
a Joker of either colour, you are treated as if you just Injured both the
Trait and the associated limb.

In addition, depending on which Body Part was considered to be Injured, you take
one of the following effects:

#### HEAD - Any Face Card (Jack, Queen, King)
    
    Your Character becomes dazed, incurring an additional point of Action Debt.
    Additionally, any Action made by the dazed Creature is made with a Bust. A
    Creature automatically snaps out of a daze at the end of the Round in which
    they initially became dazed.

#### TORSO (Even Red Numbers)

    Your Character gets hit in the mid-section, but did not take any direct
    damage to any organs. This incurs an additional point of Action Debt. You
    also lose -2 Stamina until the end of the end of the next Round.

#### ARM (Even Black Numbers)

    Your Character drops whatever it was holding with the Hand associated with
    the Injured arm. The Damage from the Attack applies as a Break Challenge to
    whatever you were holding.

#### LEG (Odd Black Numbers)

    Your Character falls Prone if it was standing. The next Attempt to move
    between Zones is made with a Bust unless you first use an Action/Reaction to
    Steady or otherwise use a Reaction to Recover.

#### TRAIT (Odd Red Numbers*)

    

#### MISS (ACES)

    You got off lucky. You might have new scar and 1 less shirt. Maybe you're
    missing the very tip of your pinky, but you narrowly escaped a more serious
    injury. Take -1 Stamina Damage.


INJURIES II - Disabling Blows
-----------------------------

General Effect: 

Immediately when the Injury is received the Character FLINCHES, incurring an
Action Debt of 3. Your max Health is also reduced by 2. This effect is removed
when you have received Class C+ or higher medical assistance.

In addition, depending on which Body Part was Injured, you take one of the
following effects:

#### HEAD
    
    Your Character becomes dangerously close to unconsciousness. They Bust
    whenever preforming any Action until they receive healing. Characters with a
    Head Injury II do not benefit from Breaks, and falling asleep drops your
    Health to 0, but you are considered Comatose as opposed to Flirting With
    Death if this occurs.


#### TORSO

    Your Character gets hit in the mid-section, but did not take any direct
    damage to an organ. They incur an additional point of Action Debt.

#### ARM

    Your Character drops whatever it was holding with the Hand associated with
    the Injured arm.

#### LEG

    Your Character falls Prone if it was standing, and also has its Stride reduced by 2. 

#### TRAIT

    Your Character becomes unable to utilize the Trait that has been struck by a
    disabling blow.
