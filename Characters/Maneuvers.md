MANEUVERS
=========

    Maneuvers are special actions that your Character is capable of. Much like
    Traits, Manuevers are capable of extra damage, bonus movement, triggering
    special Challenges and temporary Core Damage.

BASIC
-----

    These are Maneuvers that all Creature automatically have. They are clearly
    defined below, and they are staples of combat encounters. They are very nearly
    simple Challenges, with the only difference being that they have explicite
    values associated with every possible Attempt Score, and specified results of
    failure, and occassionally special rules by which their Difficulty are
    determined.

SPECIAL
-------

    These are Character specific Maneuvers that are defined at Character Creation
    and Level Ups. They are much like Traits in that you purchase with Exo Points,
    with the key difference that you set a Trigger Value for the Maneuver, and in
    the event that you generate an Attempt Score equal to or greater than the
    Maneuver's Trigger Value, you may choose to activate the Maneuver, granting its
    properties to whatever Basic Maneuver you were Attempting.

BASIC MANEUVERS
===============

SLAM
----

    As an Action, you may Attempt a Brawn Challenge. The number
    generated represents the Challenge faced by other Creatures when
    they encounter the source of the Challenge. For every 5 points
    generated by the Attempt, the Slam gains 5ft of AoE. The Damage
    Property of the weapon used to perform the Slam is applied to
    every Creature that is caught in the AoE unless they use a
    Reaction to Dodge the Slam and expend enough Stride to exit the
    AoE. 

    Alternatively, the Creature may use two Reactions, one to
    attempt a Dodge, and the other to activate a Trait, Spell, etc. to
    exit the Slam's AoE. If for whatever reason the target(s) are
    unable to exit the Slam's AoE, the Dodge is failed. Unarmed Slams
    have damage equivalent to their owner's Brawn Score plus their
    Natural Defense. 
    
    Slams are preformed with Crude weapons and by Unarmed Creatures
    mainly, but may be preformed with Ranged and Technical Weapons
    with a Bust.
    
    Attempt:        0       5       10      15      20   ...
    Slam AoE:       0       5ft     10ft    15ft    20ft ...

STRIKE
------

    As an Action, you may Attempt a Speed Challenge. The number generated
    represents the Challenge faced by other Creatures that encounter the Strike.
    Strikes always grant +1 Damage to the Weapon/Tool used in the Strike.

    For every 5 points generated by the Attempt, the Strike gains 1 point of
    Bonus Damage. The Damage Property of the weapon used to perform the Strike
    is applied to a singular Creature within the Range of the Strike unless they
    Dodge the Strike. 

    Basic Strikes do not have AoE, meaning that Stride does not need to be
    expended to avoid Basic Strikes. Unarmed Strikes have damage equivalent to
    their owner's Brawn Score plus their Natural Defense. 
    
    Strikes are preformed with Ranged and Technical weapons and by Unarmed
    Creatures, but may be preformed with Crude Weapons with a Bust.
    
    Attempt:       0       5       10      15      20   ...
    Bonus Damage:  1       2        3       4       5   ...

PUSH/YANK
---------

    Your Character may attempt to move an object or Creature that is at most 1
    Size Category larger than you. For every point you beat the Momentum score
    by, you are able to move the object or Creature by 5ft. If this movement
    causes a Creature to move a distance greater than their Remaining Stride
    (whichever is lower at the moment they were Pushed/Yanked) before
    encountering a hard surface, they Trip. If a Creature does encounter a hard
    surface, they stop moving and take 1 Damage per 5ft moved.

    Creatures that are aware of your presence may make a Brawn Challenge against
    your Push/Yank attempt and add it to their Momentum score.

DASH 
-----
    
    Your Character is able to suddenly and explosively move between two points.
    You are able to make a Speed Challenge, and for every 5 points generated by
    your Character's Attempt, you may move 5ft across any solid surface
    (vertically or horizontally) in one motion. 

    They may move over gaps or non-solid surfaces, but the Dash must start on a
    solid surface. If you end a Dash such that a Creature is within your Reach,
    any Challenges applied to them before your Turn ends is made with a Bang.
    Dashs do not consume Stride, however you may not Dash if your Character has
    a Burden of II or higher. Attacks made against you during a Dash are made
    with a Bust.  

GRAPPLE 
--------

    Your Character may attempt to grab onto and hold a Creature that is their
    Size or smaller. You force a Brawn Challenge or Speed Challenge from a
    Creature you attempt to grapple. If your Attempt Score was higher than
    theirs, your Character forces the target into their Occupied Space.

    On the Target's turn, they may retry the Challenge as either a Brawn or
    Speed Challenge, and if they fail, they may not take any voluntary action.
    If the grappled Creature sucessfully beats the Challenge, they may either
    break the Grapple, or attempt to reverse the Grapple. 

    The Grappler may make Unarmed Attacks and One-Handed Attacks as well as
    Traits/Equipment/Verbal Spells whose effects do not originate from their
    hands, torso or legs. These Actions are applied with a Bang if they are
    applied against the Grappled Creature, but applied with a Bust otherwise.
    
    The Grappler may force a Brawn Challenge from the grappled Creature, and for
    every point the Grappler's own Brawn Challenge beats them by, may move both
    Creatures 5ft in a direction of the Grappler's choosing, assuming they have
    remaining Stride/Secondary Movement. The Challenge the Grappled Creature
    must beat to escape the Grapple is set to this new value.

    A Grappler can Dash only while Grappling Creatures at least 2 Sizes smaller
    than themself, and only if they have provoked a Brawn Challenge from the
    Grappled Creature.

    You may not move a distance greater than the Grappler's Stride, doing so or
    being made to do so automatically causes both Creatures to Trip, but the
    Grapple is maintained. The Grappler may intentionally Fall with the grappled
    Creature, but both Creatures are treated as if they both just Tripped.


TACKLE
------

    Your Character may quickly move forward and throw their entire body at a
    Target. You may perform a Brawn Challenge as an Action, and for every point
    the Attempt Score is, you may move 5ft. If you contact a Creature, you may
    apply your Momentum and the result of the Brawn Challenge against their
    Momentum and also their own Brawn Challenge if they saw you coming. If you
    win this duel, you may then move both yourself and the Creature in the
    direction you were intitially moving as if you were both Dashing, up to the
    range of the Tackle.
    
    Colliding with a solid surface incurs Fall damage as if the
    tackled Creature has a Momentum Score equivalent to the Tackler's
    Momentum plus their Momentum. This damage is only applied to the
    tackled Character. Any Natural Defense possessed by either
    Creature is transfered as Damage to the other Creature.

THROW 
------

    In order to throw an Object or Creature, you perform a Brawn Challenge. For
    every point you beat the target's Momentum by in addition to the target's
    Brawn Challenge if they saw you coming, you may throw the target by 5ft.
    When they land, they take 1 point of Damage per 5ft moved plus their
    Momentum. If they contact something, the Damage is applied to whatever they
    hit as well. 

    If this object is a weapon, or otherwise an item with a Damage property, its
    Damage value is added to the damage that was just generated by the Throw. If
    the Thrown object or Creature has Natural Defense, it is treated as Damage.

    You may Throw things at any square within your Character's Reach, but they
    are considered to have moved the full distance of the Throw for purposes of
    calculating the damage dealt. 

    A Thrower may declare that they are "Throwing Long", meaning that they Bust
    while Attempting the Throw, but each point of the Attempt grants 10ft of
    distance as opposed to 5ft.

    In order to Throw an unwilling creature, you must first Grapple them. Thrown
    creatures complete all Actions with either a Boon or Bust, depending on the
    Thrower's intent until the start of the next Round/Moment. If they are
    Thrown Long, the Thrown Creature always Busts until the next Round/Moment,
    regardless of the Thrower's intent.

DODGE
-----

    Whenever a damaging Challenge is applied against you, you may take
    a Speed Challenge to avoid the source of the Challenge. Meeting
    or exceeding the Challenge allows your Character to avoid the
    Challenge completely. If the source has an AoE, the Character
    must also use their Stride or activate Self Propulsion with a
    Reaction in order to move out of the AoE. A Creature may
    intentionally Trip as a Reaction out of the AoE if they are out
    of Stride and Self Propulsion isn't available.

SPECIAL MANEUVERS
=================

    As mentioned Special Maneuvers are defined very similarly to the way Traits are
    defined, with the key difference that you do not exchange Core Points for
    Maneuver Points, instead you set a Trigger Value between 1 and 25. As an Action
    you may Attempt a Challenge with the Maneuver's Associated Core. If you meet or
    exceed the Trigger Value, the Maneuver's Properties are added to whatever Action
    was being Attempted. These Actions can be any Basic Maneuver.
