There are three main aspects of your physiology that you must consider. They are
your SIZE, SECONDARY MOVEMENT, & PERCEPTION.

SIZE
====

Being a 10ft 1200lb giant is great when you're in the thick of battle or trying to
make a guard piss his pants out of fear, but it may render you physically incapable
of entering certain areas. You should also carefully consider the logistics of keeping
your Character fed. 

Similarly, being the size of a mouse would make it extremely difficult to intimidate
anyone, but makes skulking around unnoticed almost natural.

The Size Categories that Characters are able to take on are as followings:

Big - Real World Analogue (Polar Bear)
--------------------------------------

    +1 Threat
    +2 Unarmed Strike Damage
    +3 Stamina

    Tilt 
        +2 Brawn Capacity Max
        -2 Speed Capacity Max

    General Dimensions    
    |   Height:   8 -> 10ft ~ 
    |   Weight:   800 -> 1200lbs ~
    
    Momentum: 8
    Occupied Space: 1/2 a Zone 

Medium - Real World Analogue (Average Adult Human)
-----------------------------------------------

    Dimensions    
    |   Height:   5-6ft ~ 
    |   Weight:   150-230lb ~

    Momentum: 5
    Occupied Space:  1/4 of a Zone 

Small - Real World Analogue (Adolescent Human)
==============================================
     
    Features
    --------

    Small Target: You make Active Dodges with a Bang when you are dodging attacks coming from
    Creatures that are larger than you.

    Short Gait: You Bust when making Move Action.

    Square Cube Law: The Momentum you gain from Traits is quartered to the nearest natural
    number.

    -1 Threat
    -2 Stamina
    -2 Unarmed Strike Damage

    +3 Natural Defense

    Tilt
        +2 Speed Capacity
        -2 Brawn Capacity

    Dimensions    
    |   Height:   2 -> 4ft~ 
    |   Weight:   40 -> 100lb~ 

    Momentum: 2

    Occupied Space: 1/8th of a Zone 

Each category offers variations on the following:

    Tilt
    Natural Defense
    Reach
    Momentum
    Occupied Space

### TILT

    As mentioned in the Core Stats section, you are typically able to possess a
    Core Value that is between -5 and +5 before you factor in specialized
    equipment and mutations. However, the implications of having a body that
    escapes the range of the average human anatomy either raises or lowers the
    maximum possible Cores for your Character. 

    Smaller Characters have less mass to worry about, and therefore are more
    naturally inclined to be agile, whereas larger Characters inherently have
    more muscle mass, and thus can exert more force. 

    A bonus to a Capacity raises the maximum value that either the Brawn or
    Speed Core can be by an amount equivalent to the bonus. If one side Capacity
    is expanded, it is explicitely coupled with a retraction by the other side
    of the same Capacity.

### MOMENTUM

    The bigger something is, the harder it is to force it to move, but once it
    *is* moving, the harder it is to slow it down. Your Character's Momentum is
    influenced by other things like their environment and how much equipment they
    have equipped, but the main factor is their Size. Momentum is used to determine
    the difficulty of Challenges that are meant to involuntarily move your Character.

    There are certain movement forcing Challenges you'd want to fail, like being
    lifted up an elevator, using a jet-pack, or being moved out of harm's way.
    It is a double edged sword. When your Character is already Falling, or is
    in the middle of a Trip, having a high Momentum will increase the Damage and
    Difficulty associated with these Challenges.

### NATURAL STRIDE

    Natural Stride refers to several factors that influence how quickly your
    Character can perform quick, short sprints with only second-long breaks
    inbetween. Natural Stride is added to your Speed Core to determine your
    Character's Stride, and it is set to 3 by default, but taking on a different
    body type changes this value to the one it specifies in the above chart. A
    negative Speed Core lowers your overall Stride.

    The bigger you are, the easier it is for you to move short distances
    relative to your size, but as a trade-off you have much more mass to carry,
    and thus you cap off your top speed. 

    The reverse is true for smaller Characters. 5ft for a human is "close", but
    for rat-sized Characters, it represents 9 or 10 steps.  Smaller Character
    can get quite fast, especially if they gain some sort of flight mechanism,
    but can also end up quite slow if they don't invest in mobility.

### NATURAL DEFENSE

    Natural Defense refers to a variety of factors that determine how resistant to
    damage your body is. Being bigger inherently brings on a thick cushioning of
    muscle, sinew and bone, this makes it harder for things to cut through to the
    important bits. Inversely, being smaller means you're a smaller target. You are a
    squishy blob compared to larger Creatures though, so if you DO get hit, it's a
    lot more serious. 

    Natural Defense is is added to your Brawn to determine your Defense. Defense
    cannot be greater than 10, and is set to 0 by default. Taking on a different body
    type changes this default value to the one specified in the chart above.

### REACH

    As defined in the Traits section, Reach is a value that represents how far
    away something can be before your Character is able to attack it. To
    determine if something is within Reach, you simply count the Squares between
    any space on the Battle Grid that your Character is Occupying and whatever
    you're hoping to Attack and multiple by 5 (as each Square represents a 5ft
    Cube of Space). If your Reach is equal to or greater than this value, you
    are able to Attack it. Your GM determines how close you actually have to be
    to things to interact with objects in the way you explain you want to, but
    equipment, items, mechsuits, and other special objects have Reach
    requirements baked into them, and you are always able to attack Creatures
    within your Reach assuming you have Line of Sight with them.

### OCCUPIED SPACE

    Character's possess a range of natural postures or movement patterns during
    active combat scenarios. This "field of probability" in-game is represented
    by a number of cubes that are 5ft long, 5ft wide and 5ft tall [5x5x5] in
    game. Sources of Damage may contact any point of this space and invoke a
    reaction from the Character and their Player. 

    If you have more than 1^3 // (5 x 5 x 5)ft of Occupied Space associated with
    your Character, you must distribute it in a way that makes the most sense
    given your Character's anatomy. Characters are able to bend and contort in
    ways that make sense given their anatomy, but doing so is counted as a
    Squeeze Action. When a Character Squeezes into a Space, their Occupied Space
    is reduced by half, but they reduce their Stride to 0 and Bust while
    preforming all Brawn and Speed Challenges until they Unsqueeze as an Action.

    The "Real World Analogue" subheading refers to the rough body-mass of a
    thing that actually exists. It does not lock you into a specific
    distribution of that body mass at Character Creation. Whether you take on a
    huge snake-like body, or a sentient, sixed-leg spider form it best
    determined by having a discussion about it with your GM, they will probably
    have some ideas about the Game World that limit what kind of Anatomies,
    Forms, and Species would "fit". 

    Often, GM's will tell you enough about the World they're building (or
    otherwise refer to premade Worlds) that you will get an idea what's allowed
    and what isn't. In any event, the only tangible number that must be refered
    during this discussion is your Character's Occupied Space. 

    That all said, Occupied Space must be laid out such that every Square has
    4 of its edges touching 4 edges of at least one other Square.

    This space is seperate from (but influenced by) the natural mental image players
    are meant to develope of their Characters. Your GM is at liberty to decide that
    because of your porportions (or Traits for that matter) that you are not able to
    enter a defined space within the Game World. 


PERCEPTION
==========

Perception refers to how sensitive your various sense organs are. An average human
has a score of 0 in:

        Sight
        Smell/Taste
        Hearing
        Touch

When you are trying to detect things that aren't obvious or eye-catching, your GM
might ask for a Sense Challenge, which is just a simple Challenge against your
Brain Core. 

You are able to exchange EXO points for Sense Points, which unlocks access to
the Sense Skill tree. You may either add Sense Points to any of the above Sense,
giving your Creature a bonus to Sense Challenges utilizing that sense. This
bonus may not be higher than +5. 

Otherwise you may purchase various properties for each sense that grants
abilities beyond what are biologically possible for humans.

The Sense Skill tree follows:

SIGHT
-----

        Night Vision
        ------------

            1 SP per 30ft of vision that is not affected by low-light
            environments. Details are perserved as long as some amount of light
            is present. Vision is lost in complete absence of light.

        Thermal Vision
        --------------

            1 SP per 25ft of vision that detects contrasts between the
            temperature of objects. You are able to perfectly see the shape of
            all objects around you at any light level, but details are
            inperceptable by this sight in the absense of adequate light.
            Objects/Creatures that have a temperature equivalent to the average
            ambient temperature are harder to see with Thermal Vision. 

        Telescopic Vision
        -----------------

            1 SP per 50ft of vision that does not lose detail at any range
            within the distance specified as long as light levels are adequate.
            The level of detail is equivalent to the letters on a hand-written
            note. 

        X-Ray Vision
        ------------

            2 SP per 5ft through non-metalic materials. After 4 SP have been put
            into this skill, you may see through up to 5ft of metalic materials
            in addition to the distance already acquired.

SMELL/TASTE
-----------

        Scent Tracking 
        --------------

            1 SP per 1hr of time in which your Character can smell lingering
            bio-markers in a designated fluid like air or water. These
            biomarkers leave trails that persist until destroyed by opposing
            forces. Your Character is able to distinguish between all scent
            lines present. Flowing water, vacuum environments, fire, heavy wind,
            and rain among other things destroy these lines.
        
        Social Scent   
        ------------
            
            1 SP per 8 smells that you can recognize as accurately as people
            tend to recognize faces. Each Creature that you learn the smell of
            is immediately recognizeable as that Creature assuming their scent
            has not been drastically altered. Things like perfumes do not
            prevent recognition. Items that the Creature is around daily are
            also marked with their scent, and may be recognized in the same
            fashion. You may expend one of these "slots" to recognize the
            general scent given off by a species/material instead.

        Pheremone Sensitivty
        --------------------

            1 SP per +3 to Brain Challenges where you are trying to determine
            another Creature's mood/emotions. Creatures emit certain chemicals
            that invoke a certain neurological response from members of its own species.
            Assuming your Character is aware of what message a certain pheremone
            conveys, you are given the specified bonus to Challenges. If the
            Creature is a member of your Character's Species, you automatically
            know what all pheremone messages emitted by them mean without having
            to study the Creature.

HEARING
-------

        Echo Location
        -------------

            1 SP per 15ft of 360deg sight where are are able to "see" shapes as
            long as Line Of Sight is not broken. This sense is not affected by
            light levels. Loud noises such as those from heavy machinery, cloud
            this Sense and reduce the sight range by half rounded up. This AoE
            is centered on the Character at all times.

        Perfect Ear
        -----------

            1 SP per 4 Unique Sounds your Character can perfectly recall if they
            choose to remember them. You may make your Character able to
            perfectly emulate 1/4 of these sounds which may be the voices of
            others, machine noises, or any other meaningful, indentifyable
            sound. Your Character automatically gains the appropriate mechanisms
            in order to recreate these sounds when they gain their Perfect Ear.
            These mechanisms are only apparent if the Player decides they want
            them to be.

TOUCH
-----

        Tremor Sense
        ------------

            1 SP per 30ft of range in which you can feel all movement and
            vibrations that touch any solid material your Character is also
            touching. Equipped items count as the Character for purposes of
            deciding if two Creature are both touching the same surface. You
            cannot distinguish details of things detected with Tremor Sense. The
            more massive the Creature, the "louder" it appears to this sense.

        Texture Sensitivty
        ------------------

            1 SP per 3 Unique Textures your Character can perfectly recall if they
            choose to remember them. You are able to remember a detail as minute as
            the texture of finger-prints on someone else's hands.
