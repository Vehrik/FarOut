Round Flow:

    1. Kickoff 

        The Player Group first places all their cards facedown simultaneously.
        The first player to place their card down Kicks Things Off. If two or more
        players place their first card down simulatenously, the one with the highest
        Speed Core Kicks Things Off. 

        The Bad Guys Kick Things Off differently. Depending on who they are, they
        may be coordinated enough that the GM can reasonably just say who goes
        first, otherwise the Bad Guy with the highest Speed Core goes first and the
        one with the lowest goes last. In the event that two or more Bad Guys
        have equal Speed Cores, the GM is left to their descretion to determine
        who goes first.
