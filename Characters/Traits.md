TRAITS
======
At Character Creation you are given 20 Exo points, however, applying them to your
Character is optional. You may defer their application to a later time, or decide not
to use them at all.

At Level 1, you may optionally take a -1 penalty to one of your Cores to gain an
additional 15 Exo Points. You may make this exchange up to 3 times. These points may
be exchanged for anything from to fangs, awesome kung-fu, to acid breath, to wrist
mounted laser cannons. Whatever your Trait gives you, it represents a change to your
character's appearance that is either mechanical, magical or biological that warrants
the effect it grants you. If your character suddenly able to reach out and touch
someone 30ft away, for example, it means something along along the lines of your
character is able to shoot web, it has a tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted
harpoon. Whatever it is, the GM must sign off on it.  

Your Trait is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties inform the
Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Traits won't be able to
influence the "Meta Game" (creature statistics like Hearts, Defense, etc) more than
is defined by their Properties, but the resulting Aesthetics may allow for creative
applications, or, at times, unforeseen consequences within the Narrative. The
Secondary Traits section provides a framework for building the Aesthetics of a Trait,
but is by no means exhaustive.

STEP 1) HOW MANY TRAITS?
------------------------
Whether or not you take a Trait at all should be carefully considered.  While they
are undoubtably useful, Traits incur a financial and practical consideration for you
Character. 

For every 10 EXO Points used, their Characters Hunger increases by 1.

You may have more than one Trait at once, but they all pull from the same pool of Exo
Points. 

STEP 2) WHAT PROPERTIES WILL THE TRAIT(S) HAVE?
-----------------------------------------------
NATURAL WEAPONS
===============
///////////////

DAMAGE(D)
---------
###COST: 5 EXO / 1 D
This value is used to help determine the Damage dealt by this Trait. It may either be
Force, Heat, Chemical, or Energy.  

CHALLENGE (C)            
-------------
###COST: 5 EXO / 1 C
This value is added to the Hit Check that is imposed whenever a Target tries to
Dodge, Block, or Resist contact with the Trait. This number also serves as the
Challenge for whether the afflicted Creature avoids the Traits associated Core
Damage.

AREA OF EFFECT (AoE)     
--------------------
###COST: 5 EXO / 15ft OF AoE
You may Trigger a Hit Check and/or a Core Challenge to /all/ creatures within the
Area of Effect of a Trait. There is no distinction between Friend and Foe within an
AoE. You may combine Range with Area of Effect so that the Area of Effect spreads
outward from a chosen point within its Range. The shape of an AoE is decided at Trait
Creation, it is locked into that shape until the Trait is upgraded, where the
existing AoE shape may be added to, but not subtracted from. The Point of Origin may
begin at any point adjascent to the Traits owner if the Trait has no Range.

Alternatively, the Point of Origin can occupy the same square as the Trait's owner if
that is desired, however this would cause the Trait's owner to contend with the
effects of the Trait.  

RANGE (RG)
----------
###COST: 5 EXO / 10ft OF RG
You may trigger a Hit Check or Core Check to any one Creature within the Range of
Trait. You may split Range between several projectiles, allowing you to trigger the
other associated Properties of a Trait within a designated Range, but you must split
Damage between each projectile equally. Range begins counting from adjascent space to
the Trait's owner.  On your Creature's turn, you may double the Range of an Trait,
but you Bust while making Hit Checks with the Trait.  When you buy the first 10ft of
Range, you may designate the Trait as "Heavy", which permanently adds +3 Damage to it
and doubles the Range, but always incurs a Bust when using it. 

DEFENSE (DEF)
-----------
###COST: 5 EXO / 1 Point of DEF
The quality of your Trait refers to how well it can protect you against Damage.  This
value is not added to your Character's personal Defense score, but instead is layered
ontop of it. If Defense is given Range, it may "latch" onto a Creature within this
Range. With multiple RG pools, the Trait's total DEF is spread out equally amongst
all Targets, with preference given to whomever is closest to the Point of Origin. You
may optionally decide to make the Defense Specialized, giving it a +3 against one
type of Damage (Force, Chemical, Heat, or Energy), but also giving it a -3 to a
seperate Damage type.

DURATION (DUR)
--------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 DUR
All properties that effect the Statistics of a Creature (Damage, Core Damage, Core
Boost or Defense) will be reapplied for a number of rounds equal to the Duration on
the beginning of the effected Creature's turn if they fail the relevant Challenge. If
the Trait is reapplied before its Duration expires, the Duration is refreshed, not
compounded. 

CORE DAMAGE (CD) 
----------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 CD
This value is used to determine the Core Damage, and resulting Vital Damage dealt by
this Trait. This Damage does not synergise with any other source of Core Damage, but
may be applied to the same target as a separate action. Core Damage must be
accompanied by Damage if you want it to apply through conscious resistance from the
Target. If at least 1 point of Health Damage is applied, the Creature will have to
Resist the Trait's Challenge with an appropriate Core. An afflicted Creature may not
necessarily be aware they are affected by Core Damage until they Actively attempt to
use a Core if the Trait does not also cause Damage.

STRIKE REPLENISHMENT (SR)
-------------------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 SR
This value represents how many Strikes of a Target may be replenished if the Effect
of the Trait is applied. You normally will not have to overcome a Challenge in order
to apply Strike Replenishment, but in certain circumstances (e.g. the Character you
want to heal is currently adjacent to an enemy) the GM may ask you to perform a Core
Check to see if you apply the replenishment to the correct Creature. Strike
Replenishment is not capable of replenishing exhausted Hearts by itself, but may be
combined with a Rest to do so. Buying SR implies you are adding to a SR Pool with
which you may dole out at your discretion. This Pool is regenerate after a Rest,
assuming your Creature has met its hunger requirements.

PROJECTED STRENGTH (PS)
-----------------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 PS
You may possess an ability that allows you to interact with objects or creatures at a
distance. This can be telekinesis, tentacle arms, or web shooting. You may act as
though you are controlling a Creature with a Brawn score equivalent to the Trait's
Projected Strength. 

This pseudo-creature may be damaged and destroyed. In this case, the Trait's owner
receives no damage, and is able to regenerate any lost biomass At Will (as long as
the Trait Owner has satisfied their Hunger requirments). Detatched biomass is
worthless but qualifies as DNA/Ballistic Data for Forensic Challenges. This
pseudo-creature is able to move up to the Trait's Range, but may not move further
from its owner than the Trait's Range. 

You may designate the Projected Strength as an Anchoring Projectile, giving it +10ft
of Range and +1 round of Duration, but you are not able change the position of the
Trait after it is activated, but instead you are able to interact with the produced
Biomass while the Trait has Duration, allowing you to pull any object that it hits.
If a Brawn Challenge higher that the Projected Strength is applied to or with the
Anchoring Projectile, the biomass breaks and becomes unuseable.

You may also designate the Projected Strength as a Concussive Field, giving it a
+15ft AoE and +1 PS. Concussive Fields apply as a Push Challenge to all Creatures
that make contact with the Field's AoE over the course of the Field's Trajectory. 

CONCEALMENT (~)
---------------
###COST: 5 EXO Points
A Trait with this property is not discernible at a glance. In order to discover a
Concealed Trait, a Creature must either have a specialized tool that explicitly
detects some aspect of the Concealed Trait, or be able to freely touch and grope the
Creature (as if frisking them). This protects the Trait from Analysis Challenges
preformed without meeting either of the above criteria. If one has multiple Traits,
Concealment will apply to all Traits that stemmed from the same pool of Exo points.
While the Trait is being activated/used, it loses the benefit of Concealment.
Concealment can only apply to Natural Weapons.

ANATOMY ENHANCMENTS
===================
///////////////////
REACH (RCH)
-----------
###COST: 10 EXO / 5ft OF RCH
Reach refers to how far away from something a Creature can be and still adeptly
interact with it. Typically, a Creature is able to interact with anything that is
adjascent (within 5ft) to it, but having Reach increases this space. This implicitely
increases the range of weapons. Some Weapons will have Reach requirements, meaning
that unless you possess a Trait with the specified amount of Reach, you will not be
able to use it. 

SELF PROPULSION (SP)
-----------------------
###COST: 15 EXO / 1 SP
Having Self Propulsion designates that your Character's aspect has a means to propel
themself without the use of Stride. When purchasing Self Propulsion, you must
designate it as Dash, Flight, Dig or Swim. Your Trait's Self Propulsion must be equal
to your Character's Momentum

CORE BOOST (CB)
---------------
###COST: 20 EXO / 1 CB
This value represents by how many points you may Raise a Target's designated Core by.
If this effect is applied, the Creature's Vitals are *not* changed. Boost must be
shared amongst Creatures within the Traits AoE. Core Boost radiates outward from the
Point of Origin, being divided equally if possible, but with the nearest Creature
receiving any remainder, up to a maximum of +5. That is, if you possess a Trait that
has +1 Boost and has a 20ft AoE, only the Creature nearest to the Point of Origin
will receive the Core Boost. Core Boost lasts for a number of rounds equivalent to
the Traits Duration, after which it must be reapplied with an Action.

RESIZE (RZ)
-----------
###COST: 20 EXO / SIZE CATEGORY  
Purchasing a Resize allows you to increase/decrease your Character's Size by 1
Category, incurring all the Core and Vital benefits and penalties.

CORE ENHANCMENT
---------------
###COST: 25 EXO / 1 CE
This value represents how many points you may raise a Core of your Creature by. Core Enhancment does not synergize with
any other Trait property. Unlike Core Boost, Core Enhancement *does* enhance the Vitals of the owner. Core Enhancement
are constant, and persist even while the Traits owner is unconscious.
