TRAITS
======

At Character Creation you are given 20 EXO points, however, applying them to
your Character is optional. You may defer their application to a later time, or
decide not to use them at all.

At Level 1, you may optionally take a -1 penalty to one of your Cores to gain an
additional 10 EXO Points. You may make this exchange up to 3 times during
Character creation. A Core Stat may not be lower than *-4* after all the effects
of Mutations and Core Points are applied. These points may be exchanged for
anything from to fangs, awesome kung-fu, to acid breath, to wrist mounted laser
cannons. 

Whatever your Trait gives you, it represents a change to your character's appearance
that is either mechanical, magical or biological that warrants the effect it grants
you. If your character suddenly able to reach out and touch someone 30ft away, for
example, it means something along along the lines of your character is able to shoot
web, it has a tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted harpoon. Whatever it is, the
GM must sign off on it.

Your Trait is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties inform the
Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Traits won't be able to
influence the "Meta Game" (creature statistics like Health, Stride, etc) more than
is defined by their Properties, but the resulting Aesthetics may allow for
creative applications or unforeseen consequences within the Narrative.

STEP 1) HOW MANY TRAITS?
------------------------
Whether or not you take a Trait at all should be carefully considered. While they
are undoubtedly useful, Traits incur a financial and practical consideration for you
Character. 

The bodies of Creatures can only handle so much Mutation before it starts to
stress existing body systems. At level 1, for every 20 EXO Points used, their Character's
Stamina decreases by 1. At every odd level (3, 5, 7, and 9), this threshold is
increased by 10 points. 

You may have more than one Trait at once.

STEP 2) WHAT PROPERTIES WILL THE TRAIT(S) HAVE?
-----------------------------------------------
There are two types of Traits, Natural Weapons and Anatomy Mutations. All
properties combine with other of the same type. For example, purchasing both
Damage and Range creates a Trait that can be used as a Weapon in combat that can
interact with Creatures up to the Range specified and apply the damage
specified.

NATURAL WEAPONS
===============

DAMAGE(D)
---------
###COST: 5 EXO / 2 D
    
    This value is used to determine the Damage dealt by this Trait whenever it
    contacts a Creature. This Damage can only be applied through use of the
    Trait directly. It may either be Force, Fire, Frost, Poison, or Electric.
    Damage automatically becomes Ranged Damage if the Trait also has Range, but
    otherwise you must specifiy it as Crude or Technical.
    
    When the first point of Damage is bought, you may designate the Trait as
    Synergizing. Doing so implies that all Damage purchased for the Trait is
    Synergistic Damage, meaning that it can either be used as normal, but also
    have it combine with the Damage from one other source such as a Weapon, or
    another existing Trait. Synergizing Damage can only be combined with Damage
    with aligning types. Synergistic Damage costs 10 EXO per point of it instead
    of 5.

    You may also designate Damage as Simple when the first point is bought.
    Doing so incurs an additional cost of 5 EXO, and disqualifies the Trait from
    having any other properties except Range and Core Damage, but this allows
    you to utilize the Trait as if it was a normal Weapon. Traits with Simple
    Damage can also benefit from Reach.

RANGE (RG)
----------
###COST: 5 EXO / 10ft OF RG

    You may trigger a Challenge against any one Creature within the Range of the
    Trait. You may split Range into several different pools, allowing you to
    trigger the other associated Properties of a Trait to multiple Creatures
    within its designated Range. Damage must be split between each projectile
    equally, with no partial values allowed. Range begins counting from space
    adjascent to the Trait's maximum Reach (5ft by default). 

    On your Creature's Turn, assuming the projectile produced by the Trait was
    designated as Slow (i.e. not bullets or lazers or eldritch bolts) you may attempt a
    Long Shot, where you temporarily double the Range of an Trait, but you Bust
    while making the Challenge with the Trait. Fast Projectiles gain 20ft of
    bonus Range, but may not use this Range doubling mechanic. 

    When you buy the first 10ft of Range of a Trait, you may also designate the
    Trait as "Heavy", which permanently adds +2 Damage to it and doubles the
    Range, but always incurs a Bust when using it. Heavy Traits cannot have Slow
    projectiles. 

    When you go to purchase Range, you may designate it as Dextrous. This incurs
    a 5 EXO cost immediately, and also doubles the cost to 10 EXO / 10ft of
    Range for this Trait. Dextrous Range is capable of wielding weapons,
    interacting with objects and activating items just as adeptly as the owner's
    natural hands. When you spend the initial 5 EXO to designate Range as
    Dextrous Range, you automatically gain an additional Hand to wield weapons
    and items with.  If the Trait has Damage, it is added to the new Hand's
    Unarmed Strike Damage, Synergistic Damage applies as normal.


AREA OF EFFECT (AoE)     
--------------------
###COST: 5 EXO / 15ft OF AoE

    You may Trigger a Core Challenge to *all* creatures within the Area of
    Effect of a Trait. There is no distinction between Friend and Foe within an
    AoE. You may combine Range with Area of Effect so that the Area of Effect
    spreads outward from a chosen point within its Range. 

    The shape of an AoE is decided at Trait Creation, it is locked into that
    shape until the Trait is upgraded, where the existing AoE shape may be added
    to, but not subtracted from. The Point of Origin may begin at any point
    adjascent to the Traits owner if the Trait has no Range.
    
    Alternatively, the Point of Origin can occupy the same square as the Trait's
    owner if that is desired, however this would cause the Trait's owner to
    contend with the effects of the Trait whenever it is activated.  

CORE DAMAGE (CD) 
----------------
###COST: 5 EXO / 2 CD
    
    This value is used to determine the penalty applied to a Core of a target
    Creature once it interacts with the Trait/its products. Core Damage must be
    accompanied by Damage or Integrity if you want it to apply through conscious
    resistance from the Target. An afflicted Creature may not necessarily be
    aware they are affected by Core Damage until they actively Attempt to use a
    Core if the Trait does not also cause Damage.

    If a single Core of a Creature is reduced to -5, that Creature can only
    preform 1 Action per Round/Moment, and if two Cores are reduced to -5, that
    Creature is Incapacitated, meaning that it can perform no Actions. Vitals
    are not affected by changes to their Core.

CORE BOOST (CB)
---------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 CB
    
    This value represents by how many points you may Raise a Target's designated
    Core by. If this effect is applied, the Creature's Vitals are *not* changed.
    Boost must be shared amongst Creatures within the Traits AoE if it has AoE.
    Core Boost radiates outward from the Point of Origin, being divided equally
    if possible, but with the nearest Creature receiving any remainder, up to a
    maximum of +5. Creatures may not have a Core boosted beyond its Maximum (5
    by default). 

    That is, if you possess a Trait that has +1 Core Boost and has a 20ft AoE,
    only the Creature nearest to the Point of Origin will receive the Core
    Boost. Core Boost lasts for a number of rounds equivalent to the Traits
    Integrity (or at least until the end of the boosted Creature's Turn) after
    which it must be reapplied with an action. Core Boost is not generic, you
    must specify which Core it boosts when you purchase it.

CONCEALMENT (~)
---------------
###COST: 5 EXO
    
    A Trait with this property is not discernible at a glance. In order to
    discover a Concealed Trait, a Creature must either have a specialized tool
    that explicitly detects some aspect of the Concealed Trait, or be able to
    freely touch and grope the Creature, as if frisking them. This protects the
    Trait from detection if neither of the above criteria are met. If one has
    multiple Traits, Concealment must be purchased for each seperate Trait.
    While the Trait is being activated/used, it loses the benefit of
    Concealment. 

INTEGRITY (ITG)
--------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 ITG
    
    All properties of a Trait (Damage, Core Damage, Core Boost) will be
    reapplied to the Target(s) at the beginning of every Round until the Trait's
    products are reduced to an Integrity of 0.

    If a Trait has even 1 point of Integrity, it implies that it produces some
    tangible material that persists in the Game World until it is
    destroyed/dispersed by oppossing forces. 

    The Integrity of a Trait's products are reduced by 1 whenever they are
    Challenged, but the Integrity is reduced to 0 if they are overcome by an
    oppossing Challenge and the Trait's products are destroyed. Traits with
    constructive properties like Core Boost automatically lose 1 point of
    Integrity at the beginning of every round. 

    You must designate the product's Form as either gas, liquid, or
    solid. Creatures are able to interact with any substances with Integrity in
    ways that makes sense given its Form and other aesthetics.

    A Trait's products may also be used as improvized tools to complete a
    Challenge, and in these cases the Integrity is reduced by 1 whenever they
    are used. The shape and size of a Trait's products are set at Trait
    Creation, and cannot be changed at will.

    Something with Integrity has Momentum equivalent to its Integrity unless it
    is a gas, in which case the Momentum is capped at 0. 

    If the Trait is reapplied to Squares occupied by its products before their
    Integrity is depleted, the Integrity is refreshed, not added to. Traits with
    Integrity may be set as traps in ways that make sense for its given Form.
    Traps laid in this way require a Sense Challenge equivalent to Activation
    Challenge preformed by the owner in order to detect it. 

EFFECT CHALLENGE (EC)
--------------------
###COST: 5 EXO / 1 EC

    In addition to the primary effects of the Trait (i.e. Damage or Core
    Damage), you are able to assign the product of your Trait an Effect. This
    Effect is any Challenge your Character would normally be able to preform,
    but instead, it is treated as if it produced the Attempt score equivalent to
    the assigned Effect Challenge. You must designate exactly what the Effect
    entails, however the Effect cannot directly influence the Statistics of a
    Creature. 

    For example, a Character may have a Trait that allows it to shoot a string
    of web of Integrity 2 out by 30ft. If this Trait was also given a Brawn
    Effect Challenge of 4 that's intended to allow the web to latch onto any
    surface it touches, the web would be treated as if it just completed a Brawn
    Challenge with an Attempt of 4 whenever it does encounter a surface.  The
    aesthetics of a Trait are taken into account by the GM when they decide if
    the Effect is applied successfully. Effect Challenges do not reduce the
    Integrity of a Trait's products when it activates.


HEALTH REPLENISHMENT (HR)
-------------------------
###COST: 10 EXO / 1 HR
    
    This value represents how many Hits of a Target may be replenished if the
    Effect of the Trait is applied. You normally will not have to overcome a
    Challenge in order to apply Health Replenishment, but in certain
    circumstances (e.g. the Character you want to heal is currently grappled an
    enemy) the GM may ask you to perform a Core Check to see if you apply the
    replenishment to the correct Creature. Hit Replenishments may also be used
    to replenish expended Stamina instead.

    Buying HR implies you are adding to a HR Pool with which you may dole out at
    your discretion. 1 Point of HR is replenished per hour of Break Time
    assuming that a Creature has met its nutritional requirements. 

ANATOMY MUTATIONS
=================

BONUS HANDS(BH)
---------------
###COST: 10 EXO / BH
    
    Typically, Creatures have two "hands" that they can wield items with. All
    Creatures are considered ambidextrous for all Challenges. Gaining an extra
    Hand allows you to simultaneously wield 3 Weapons at a time (or some
    combination of 2-Handed Weapons and 1-Handed Weapons). Gaining more than 1
    EH allows for a larger variety of weapon combinations you can utilize.
    Despite there name, Hands do not have to be actual hands. Like all Traits,
    the details of their aesthetics is between you and your table-mates.

REACH (RCH)
-----------
###COST: 15 EXO / +5ft OF RCH
    
    Reach refers to how far away from something a Creature can be and still
    adeptly interact with it. Typically, a Creature is able to interact with
    anything that is adjascent (within 5ft) to it, but having Reach increases
    this radius, similar to Dextrous Range, except Reach applies to all existing
    Hands a Creature has. This implicitely increases the range of weapons. Some
    items will have Reach requirements, meaning that unless you possess a Trait
    with the specified amount of Reach, you will not be able to use it. 

RESIZE (RZ)
-----------
###COST: 15 EXO / SIZE CATEGORY  
    
    There are 7 Size Categories. From smallest to largest they are:

                    Minute
                    Tiny
                *-----------*
     Average    |   Small   |
      Human ----I   Medium  |
      Sizes     |   Big     |
                *-----------*
                    Huge
                    Massive

    Each size has various properties that alter your Character's baseline
    physiology. These alternations are not all beneficial. Each Size Category is
    explained in detail in the Physiology section.


CORE ENHANCEMENT
---------------
###COST: 15 EXO / 1 CE
    
    This value represents how many points you may raise a Core of your Creature by.
    Core Enhancment does not synergize with any other Trait property. Unlike Core
    Boost, Core Enhancement *does* enhance the Vitals and Capacities of the owner.
    Core Enhancement are constant, and persist even while the Traits owner is
    unconscious.

STEP 3) WHAT IS THE ACTIVATION COST OF THE TRAIT?
-------------------------------------------------

Anatomy Mutations are alternations that fundamentally alter the foundation of
your Anatomy. On the other hand, Natural Mutations build off of pre-existing
Anatomy, and almost always involve creating additional material in order to
apply effects or otherwise utilizing specialized limbs. 

There are additional costs associated with using Natural Weapons. Natural
Weapons are given a Power Level, which is equal to its (EXO / 10)^. Every time a
Trait is used, in addition to the Cards discarded normally, you will also need
to discard 1 additional Card per Power Level. This means if you used 20 EXO to
build a Trait, using that Trait forces you to discard a total of 3 Cards every
time it is used; 1 for the Action itself, and 2 because of the Traits Power
Level.
