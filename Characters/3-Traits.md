TRAITS
======

    At Character Creation you are given 3 Splice Points points, however, applying them to
    your Character is optional. You may defer their application to a later time, or
    decide not to use them at all. You may also exchange 2 Splice Points for 1
    Slant.
    
    At Level 1, you may optionally exchange 1 Slant in order to gain 2 Splice
    Points Points.  You may make this exchange up to 3 times during Character
    creation. After this time, you must have the appropriate amount of Prestige
    and Credit in order to gain additional Splice Points points in the form of
    Items, Equipment and Mutations.
    
    Splice Points may be exchanged for anything from to fangs, to AI-designed
    martial arts, to acid breath, to wrist mounted laser cannons.
    
    Whatever your Trait is, it represents a change to your character's
    appearance that is either mechanical, technological or biological that
    warrants the effect it grants you.

    If your character able to reach out and touch someone 30ft away, for
    example, it means something along the lines of your character is able to
    shoot web, it has a tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted harpoon
    launcher. The exact description of a Trait depends on the Character's
    back-story, the 'function' of the Trait and the narrative context of the
    game you are playing.

    Your Trait is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties inform
    the Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Traits won't be
    able to influence creature statistics like Strikes, Stamina, and Threat more
    than is defined by their Properties, but the resulting Aesthetics may allow
    for creative applications or unforeseen consequences within the Narrative.
    For example, having fangs would make intimidating people slightly easier,
    but would make comforting a distressed child harder. Oozing acid would be a
    great way to make people respect your personal space, but makes finding a
    restaurant that's willing to seat you almost impossible.

    Whatever your Trait ends up being you must decide on the following three
    details:

            1. The location of the Trait. You may designate the Trait as being
               anchored to, projected from or embedded in either your Torso,
               Head, or one of your Limbs. 

               Multiple Traits may be anchored to/embedded in the same portion
               of your body. Traits may become less effective or even unuseable
               if the body part the Trait is associated with becomes Injured or
               Disabled. 

               If the limb you place the Trait on also houses a Hand (by default
               this is your arms), the Trait will consume the Hand unless you
               expend 1 additional Splice Point in order to conserve the Hand.
               If a Trait's Form allows for it and the Hand is conserved, you
               may potentially combine the properties of your Trait and a Weapon
               held in the augmented Hand.

               You may optionally designate the Trait as a Crux, giving you 3
               additional Splice Points points to use on the Trait designated as
               a Crux, but if the Crux is damaged, it could Fail
               Catastrophically.

            2. The material the Trait is made of. A Trait may be comprised of
               either Metal, Biomass or Energy or some combination thereof. It
               will influence to what degree certain hazards will effect your
               Character. Each category of material will also incur one of the
               following bonuses based on which material the Trait is *mostly*
               comprised of:
                    
                        Metal - You gain +2 point of Natural Defense and the
                        limb automatically qualifies as a Crude Weapon with a
                        Damage of 2 and a Range of 0. You may expand upon this
                        Damage if you make the Trait Crude as well, but you may
                        also create a Technical Trait and have it double as a
                        improvised Crude Weapon. 

                        Biomass - As long as the Trait is not a Crux, the Player
                        may choose to have the Trait Concealed with no
                        additional Splice Point Cost. Damaged Traits may be
                        forced to work as normal by expending 1 Stamina for a
                        single use. You may also expend 2 Stamina in order to
                        force a Disabled Biomass Trait to work for a single use
                        as if it were merely Malfunctioning.

                        Energy - The Trait gains a Range of 1 Zone, 1 Point of
                        Damage and 5v3 for no additional cost. 

            3. The general dimensions of the Trait. You don't need to have the
               measurements down to the inch, but you need a solid concept of
               whether the shoulder mounted flamethrower means you're adding 3
               seperate wine-bottle sized cynlinders onto your upper arm, or if
               you're carrying what amounts to a back-pack filled with jet fuel
               on your back. This mass isn't anymore vulnerable than any other
               part of the body unless the Trait is also a Crux, in which case
               you need to carefully considered how to distribute the mass of
               your Trait. While not meant to be exact, the general guideline
               for a Splice Points to Volume relationship is 1 litre of
               distilled water to 1 Splice Point spent.

STEP 1) HOW MANY TRAITS?
========================

    Whether or not you take a Trait at all should be carefully considered. While they
    are undoubtedly useful, Traits incur a financial and practical consideration for you
    Character. 
    
    The bodies of Creatures can only handle so much Mutation before it starts to
    stress existing body systems. At level 1, for every 4 Splice Points used, their
    Character's Stamina decreases by 1. At every odd level of Prestige (3, 5, 7,
    and 9), this threshold is increased by 2 point. 

    Every 3 Splice Point spent adds 1 point of Burden to your Character. As a
    default, you are able to gather and utilize as much as 24 Splice Points, but
    your GM may lower or raise this number depending on what type of game they
    are running.
    
    You may have more than one Trait at once.

STEP 2) WHAT PROPERTIES WILL THE TRAIT(S) HAVE?
===============================================

There are two types of Traits, Natural Weapons and Anatomy Mutations.

NATURAL WEAPONS
---------------

### DAMAGE(D)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points / 1 D
    
    This value is used to determine the Damage dealt by this Trait OR its
    products whenever it contacts a Creature. You must decide on the first point
    of Damage bought whether the Trait deals damage with projectiles or by
    virtue of its form. This Damage may either be Force, Fire, Frost, Poison, or
    Electric Damage. 

    When you buy the initial point of Damage, you must specifiy it as Crude or
    Technical. As with all Crude items, it cannot benefit from more than 1 Zone
    of Range, but the Range given is treated as Threat instead.

    Any Trait that has Range is automatically a Technical weapon.

    Damage reduces the Integrity of something whenever it contacts it by the
    amount of Damage it has. 

    If the Trait utilizes projectiles to apply its Damage, the projectile
    continues to travel along the same trajectory until it encounters a total
    amount of Integrity equivalent to its Damage. In other words, if a
    projectile with 4 Damage hits an Object with Integrity 2, it will fly throug
    the object, and continue flying until it encounters another object with
    Integrity 2, or two objects with 1 Integrity each, OR until it reaches its
    maximum Range, whichever comes first.

### RANGE (R)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points / 3 Zones

    This value determines how many Zones away your Trait's missiles are able to
    feasibly apply the Trait's other properties. This is seperate from
    determining if you actually hit your Target, this value is used to determine
    if you can even try. Range rounds up, meaning that you can target a Creature
    even if it is positioned in the Zone such that they are as far away from
    your Character as they can be while still being within Range.

    If your Trait has less than 6 Zones of Range, it implies it produces Slow
    projectiles. If this is the case, you may intentionally Bust on your next
    use of the Trait in order to double the Range for that use.

    Purchasing Range for Crude Traits only grants 1 Zone of Range but still
    costs 1 Splice Point, however, this Range is treated as Threat for all
    purposes.

    If you do not purchase Volume or Integrity for a Trait, it implies that the
    Trait does not produce a projectile, but rather that you are flinging out a
    limb (or pseduolimb) that is vunerable to Quick Attacks all along the length
    of its Range. Pseudolimbs has roughly the same diameter as the rest of the
    Character's limbs. This enables you to utilize the Trait without having to
    keep track of how much material your Creature is still able to output.

### VOLUME (V)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points / 10 Cubic Feet (10v3)

    Products of this Trait are formed at any point adjascent to or on the
    Character that possess this Trait and may be fired up to the Range of the
    Trait. Once this point is chosen, it is fixed unless the Trait gets Spliced.
    This won't matter much unless your Character's movement is restricted
    somehow.

    When 10 Cubic Feet (10v3) are bought, you are free to shape and destribute
    the Volume of the Trait's products in a way that makes most sense for you
    intentions, but no matter how you arrange it, it cannot add Damage, Stress
    or any other property to the Trait for free. 

    You may only produce as much material as you buy Volume for. You recover 5 +
    Brawn Volume per hour of Break as long as your Character has Stamina. A
    single projectile may use as little as 1/10 of a cubic foot (about the size
    of a human's clenched fist). You may only increment the Volume of
    projectiles by 1/10ths of a cubic foot. You may expend 1 Stamina to gain
    5v3 of additional volume.

    You may split the Volume between multiple projectiles that are launched
    simultaneously as part of the Trait activation, but each projectile must
    have at least 1 point of Damage, Boost, Stress or Effect and
    the Range of the Trait must be split such that each projectile has at least
    1 Zone of Range. The projectiles produced do not need to be equivalent in
    Volume.

### STRESS
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1 point of Stress
    
    This value is used to determine the penalty applied to a Capacity of a
    target Creature once it interacts with the Trait/its products. Stress must
    be accompanied by Damage or Integrity if you want it to apply through
    conscious resistance from the Target. 

    An afflicted Creature may not necessarily be aware they are affected by
    Stress until they actively Attempt to use a Core if the Trait does
    not also cause Damage, unless the Player inflicting Stress has
    decided they have wanted it to cause sensory effects at all times.

    If a single Core of a Creature is reduced to -5, that Creature may only
    perform 2 Actions per Round. If Two Cores are reduced to -5, the Creature,
    the Creature may only perform 1 Action per Round. As normal, if a Creature
    accumulates 10 points of either Physical or Mental Stress, they fall
    Unconscious.

    Stress is not generic, you must designate Stress as either Mental or
    Physical Stress.

### INTEGRITY 
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 1 Integrity
    
    All properties of a Natural Weapon (Damage, Stress, Boost, Effect
    Challenege) will be reapplied to the anything touching the Trait's products
    at the beginning of every Round until the Trait's products are reduced to an
    Integrity of 0. The owner has implied immunity to the Trait's hazardous
    properties, but they may waive this immunity to grant the Trait 1 additional
    point of Damage.

    Trait Integrity implies that it produces tangible material that persists in
    the Game World until it is destroyed/dispersed by oppossing forces. Volume
    implies the same, but without Integrity the products do not persist in the
    Game World after they apply their properties.
     
    The Integrity of a Trait's products are reduced by 1 whenever they are
    Challenged, but are destroyed immediately if they encounter a Challenge that
    is higher than their Integrity. The GM determines if the Integrity fails
    before they reduce it by 1.

    You must designate the product's Form as either gas, liquid, or solid. A
    Trait's products may be used as Simple Tools to help complete a Challenge. 

    Integrity implicitely grants the products of a Trait Momentum equivalent to
    the Integrity / 3 rounded down. If the products are gaseous, the Momentum is
    capped at 0. Reducing Intergrity reduces the Momentum of the generated
    product.

    A Trait with Integrity and no Volume can only produce about a basketball
    worth of material (~1/4 cubic feet).
    
    If the Trait is reapplied to space occupied by its products before their
    Integrity is depleted, the Integrity is compounded up to a maximum value of
    15. 

    Traits with Integrity may be set as traps in ways that make sense for its
    given Form. Traps laid in this way have a Detection Challenge equivalent to
    the Set Trap Challenge Attempted by the trapper.


### BOOST
#### COST: 4 Splice Points per 1 Boost
    
    This value represents by how many points you may Raise a Target's designated
    Core by. If this effect is applied, the Creature's Vitals are changed.
    Boost must be shared amongst Creatures within the Traits Volume if it has Volume.
    Boost radiates outward from the Point of Origin, being divided equally
    if possible, but with the nearest Creature receiving any remainder, up to a
    maximum of +5. 

    That is, if you possess a Trait that has +1 Boost and has a 20ft
    Volume, only the Creature nearest to the Point of Origin will receive the
    Boost. Boost lasts until its products are destroyed or at least
    until the end of the boosted Creature's Turn if it has no Integrity.  Core
    Boost is not generic, you must specify which Core it boosts when you
    purchase it.

    Boost does not penalize the associated Core of the one you're boosting.
    In other words, if you Boosted your Brawn by +2, your Speed would not be
    drained by -2. Reapplying Boost from the same source only refreshes the
    duration as opposed to adding to the Boost.

    Multiple sources of Boost do add to eachother, but they must come from
    different Creatures, items or similar; it is not enough that you have two
    Traits that boost the same Core. A single Core may not be Boosted by more
    than 5.

    For every 5 points of Boost a Creature receives, the gain 1 point of Burden.


### CONCEALMENT (~)
#### COST: 1 Splice Point
    
    A Trait with this property is not discernible at a glance. In order to
    discover a Concealed Trait, a Creature must either have a specialized tool
    that explicitly detects the material the Concealed Trait is made of, or
    otherwise the inspecting Creature is able to freely touch and grope the
    Creature, as if frisking them. This protects the Trait from detection if
    neither of the above criteria are met. Activating the Trait makes it
    vulnerable to analysis, and Creatures who saw the Trait activated do not
    forget that you have it.

    If one has multiple Traits, Concealment must be purchased for each seperate
    Trait. While the Trait is being activated/used, it loses the benefit of
    Concealment. Purchasing Concealment twice makes the Trait completely
    inperceivable by the naked eye. A DNA Analysis would need to be performed to
    determine the existence the of the Trait without otherwise having seen it
    being used.

    The Cost of concealing a Crux is double unless the Trait is made of mostly
    Biomass.

### EFFECT CHALLENGE (EC)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points / 1 EC

    In addition to the other primary effects of the Trait (i.e. Damage or
    Stress), you are able to assign the product of your Trait an
    Effect. 

    This Effect can be any Challenge your Character would normally be able to
    preform either empty handed or with a simple tool, but instead, it is
    treated as if it produced the Attempt score equivalent to the assigned
    Effect Challenge.

    A simple tool is any object that *only* redirects and/or magnifies physical
    extertion supplied by its user(s). This rules out anything that requires
    chemical reactions, non-simple machines or electronics to perform a task.

    The Effect is only as strong as you make it; you cannot artificially
    multiply the potency of the Trait through its aesthetics.

    You may "layer" Effects to make them more potent or perform more complex
    actions. A single Effect may not have a Difficulty of higher than 15.

### TELEPATHIC LINK
#### COST: 1 Splice Point

    Typically, any products of a Trait are mindless objects. You may give your
    Trait either a Simple Telephatic Link for 1 Splice Point, or a Complex
    Telepathic Link for 2 Splice Points.

    A Simple Telepathic Link(STL) allows information to flow from the Trait's
    products to the Creature that created it. A STL allows you sense the
    position of any intact products created by the Trait. You can give the
    products 1 sense for 1 Splice Point. The 5 Senses are Sight, Touch, Smell,
    Hearing, and Taste. If a Trait's products are given a sense, they are just
    as keen as the Creature's and retain all special senses, and use the owner's
    Brain Core to Attempt the Sense Challenge.

    A Complex Telepathic Link (CTL) carries all the same benefits of a STL, but
    also allows you to issue commands to the product of the Trait, however you
    can only instruct it to do one of three things:

        1) Go inert. This perserves the link, but the product(s) will not output
        any hazardous or beneficial effects until you command it to become
        active again. If you possess the ability to do this, you may choose to
        have the products to come out inert when they are intially produced.

        2) Activate Effect. You may instruct the product(s) to activate any
        Effect Challenge that it possesses. The product is considered to borrow
        the Actions of its owner if the owner commands it to activate more than
        once per round.

        3) Become active. This causes an otherwise inert product to become
        active and immediately emit its effects if it has not already done so
        this round.

    Telepathic Links have a range of 100ft, but this range may be doubled for 1
    Splice Point per doubling. If the range of a Telepathic Link is exceeded, it
    breaks, but automatically reconnects if the Trait and its owner get within
    the links max range of eachother.

### STAMINA REPLENISHMENT (SR)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points / 1 SR
    
    This value represents how much Stamina of a Target may be replenished if the
    Effect of the Trait is applied. 

    If a Character has Injuries II and Injury I, receiving Stamina Replenishment
    either partially or completely removes them, and the Stress associated with
    them. An Injury II requires 2 SR to be completely healed, but can be
    downgraded to a Injury I with 1 SR. Likewise, a Injury I is completely
    healed with 1 SR. Injuries are healed in the order that the Healer chooses.

    Injuries will be healed before a Creature's Stamina is replenished.
 
    Buying SR implies you are adding to a SR Pool with which you may dole out at
    your discretion. 1 Point of SR is replenished per hour of Break Time
    assuming that a Creature has met its nutritional requirements. 

ANATOMY MUTATIONS
-----------------

### BONUS NATURAL DEFENSE
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1.5 Bonus Natural Defense 

    You Creature's Natural Dodge Attempts are increased by the amount
    of Bonus Dodge a Trait has. Other effects of increased Natural Defense
    (higher Fall Damage and stronger Unarmed Strikes) also apply. 

    Bonus Natural Defense is rounded down to to the nearest natural number.

### BONUS STAMINA
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1.5 Bonus Natural Defense 

    Your Creature's Stamina is increased by 1 per point of Bonus Stamina
    purchased.

### BONUS HANDS
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per Hand 
    
    Typically Creatures have two "hands" that they can wield items with in a
    High Stress Scenario. Gaining an extra Hand allows you to simultaneously
    wield 3 1-Handed Weapons at a time, or some combination of 2-Handed Weapons
    and 1-Handed Weapons. 

    Gaining more than 1 Hand allows for a larger variety of weapon combinations.
    Despite there name, Hands do not have to be actual hands. Like all Traits,
    the details of their aesthetics is between you and your table-mates. As
    always, the Creature needs to account for the Momentum of the Weapons he is
    holding with any Hand.

    Purchased Hands may be placed on any limb, generate another limb that's the
    same size as the Creature's other limbs, or be placed on a pseudo-limb
    generated by a mutation.

    All Creatures are considered ambidextrous for all Challenges.

### SENSE ENHANCEMENT
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 3 Sense Points

    You are able to enhance your Senses with either direct Attempt Bonuses, or
    unique sight enhancments that broaden the spectrum of what and how your
    Character can perceive the Game World.

    This system is described within the Physiology section of this book. Amongst
    other things, you can gain the ability to see in the dark, or sense
    the heart beats of other Creatures.

### RESIZE 
#### COST: 3 Splice Points per Size Category  
    
    There are 3 Size Categories that Player Characters can be created under.
    From smallest to largest they are:

    Small   
    Medium  
    Big     

    Each size has various properties that alter your Character's baseline
    physiology. These alternations are not all beneficial. Each Size Category is
    explained in detail in the Physiology section.

DAMAGED TRAITS
==============

Traits aren't just balls of numbers that you tap your finger on to make the bad
guys go away. They're relics of your Characters story AND features on your
Character's anatomy. A Character more than likely sees there Trait as a part of
their body or at least as a important item that deserves respect. Regardless,
you will more than likely damage your Trait.

Traits have a chance to become Damaged whenever the limb their attached
to/housed within become Damaged. It depends on how hard the hit was, but a
Damaged Trait can be either Malfunctioning or Disabled.

Using a Malfunctioning Trait incurs a Bust whenever you are using it. A Disabled
Trait cannot be used at all.

Crux can Catastrophically Fail if they become Damaged. When a Crux
Catastrophically Fails, it imparts all its negative effects on its owner as if
it was activated with an Attempt of 15. The owner automatically fails any
Challenges applied to them due to a Catastrophically Failing Crux.

If the Trait is a Anatomy Mutation, half of all of the Splice Points placed into
it are treated as Damage that applies to its owner.

Boost is treated as Stress in these instances. If the Trait has Range or Volume,
the GM has free reign to direct the Trait's involuntary activation as they see
fit.
