TRAITS
======

    At Character Creation you are given 3 EXO points, however, applying them to
    your Character is optional. You may defer their application to a later time, or
    decide not to use them at all.
    
    At Level 1, you may optionally exchange 1 Slant in order to gain 2 EXO Points.
    You may make this exchange up to 3 times during Character creation.
    
    EXO may be exchanged for anything from to fangs, to AI-designed martial arts, to
    acid breath, to wrist mounted laser cannons. 
    
    Whatever your Trait is, it represents a change to your character's appearance
    that is either mechanical or biological that warrants the effect it grants you.
    If your character suddenly able to reach out and touch someone 30ft away, for
    example, it means something along the lines of your character is able to shoot
    web, it has a tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted harpoon. The exact
    description of a Trait depend on the Character's back-story, the 'function'
    of the Trait and the narrative context of the game you are playing.

    Your Trait is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties inform the
    Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Traits won't be able to
    influence the "Meta Game" (creature statistics like Health, Stride, Reach, etc)
    more than is defined by their Properties, but the resulting Aesthetics may allow
    for creative applications or unforeseen consequences within the Narrative.

    Whatever your Trait ends up being you must decide on the following three
    details:

            1. The location of the Trait. You may designate the Trait as being
               anchored to or embedded in either your Torso, Head, or one of
               your Limbs. Multiple Traits may be anchored to/embedded in the
               same portion of your body. Traits may become less effective or
               even unuseable if the body part the Trait is associated with
               becomes Injured. 

            2. The material the Trait is made of. A Trait may be comprised of
               either Metal, Biomass or Energy. 

STEP 1) HOW MANY TRAITS?
========================

    Whether or not you take a Trait at all should be carefully considered. While they
    are undoubtedly useful, Traits incur a financial and practical consideration for you
    Character. 
    
    The bodies of Creatures can only handle so much Mutation before it starts to
    stress existing body systems. At level 1, for every 4 EXO Points used, their Character's
    Stamina decreases by 1. At every odd level (3, 5, 7, and 9), this threshold is
    increased by 2 point. 
    
    You may have more than one Trait at once.

STEP 2) WHAT PROPERTIES WILL THE TRAIT(S) HAVE?
===============================================

There are two types of Traits, Natural Weapons and Anatomy Mutations.

NATURAL WEAPONS
---------------

### DAMAGE(D)
#### COST: 1 EXO / 2 D
    
    This value is used to determine the Damage dealt by this Trait whenever it
    contacts a Creature. This Damage can only be applied through use of the
    Trait directly. It may either be Force, Fire, Frost, Poison, or Electric.
    Damage automatically becomes Ranged Damage if the Trait also has Range, but
    otherwise you must specifiy it as Crude or Technical.
    
    When the first point of Damage is bought, you may designate the Trait as
    Synergizing. Doing so implies that all Damage purchased for the Trait is
    Synergistic Damage, meaning that it can either be used as normal, or have it
    combine with the Damage from one other source such as a Weapon, or another
    existing Trait. Synergizing Damage can only be combined with Damage with the
    same type. Synergistic Damage costs 1 EXO per 2 points of it instead of 5.

    You may also designate Damage as Simple when the first point is bought.
    Doing so incurs an additional cost of 5 EXO, and disqualifies the Trait from
    having any other properties except Range and Core Damage, but this allows
    you to utilize the Trait as if it was a normal Weapon. Traits with Simple
    Damage can also benefit from Reach only if an extra Hand is bought as well.

### RANGE
#### COST: 1 EXO per 10ft of Range

    You may trigger a Challenge against any one Creature within the Range of the
    Trait. You may split Range into several different pools, allowing you to
    apply the other associated Properties of a Trait to multiple Creatures
    within its designated Range. Damage must be split between each projectile
    equally, with no partial values allowed. Range begins counting from space
    adjascent to the Trait's maximum Reach (5ft by default). 

    On your Creature's Turn, assuming the projectile produced by the Trait was
    designated as Slow (i.e. not bullets or lazers) you may attempt a
    Long Shot, where you temporarily double the Range of an Trait, but you Bust
    while making the Challenge with the Trait. Fast Projectiles gain 20ft of
    bonus Range, but may not perform Long Shots. 

    When you buy the first 10ft of Range of a Trait, you may also designate the
    Trait as "Heavy", which permanently adds +2 Damage to it and doubles the
    Range, but always incurs a Bust when using it. Heavy Traits cannot have Slow
    projectiles. 

    When you go to purchase Range, you may designate it as Dextrous. This incurs
    a 5 EXO cost immediately, and also doubles the cost to 10 EXO per 10ft of
    Range for this Trait. Dextrous Range is capable of wielding weapons,
    interacting with objects and activating items just as adeptly as the owner's
    natural hands. When you spend the initial 5 EXO to designate Range as
    Dextrous Range, you automatically gain an additional Hand to wield weapons
    and items with.  If the Trait has Damage, it is added to the new Hand's
    Unarmed Strike Damage, Synergistic Damage applies as normal.

### AREA OF EFFECT (AoE)
#### COST: 1 EXO per 15ft OF AoE

    You may Trigger a Core Challenge to *all* creatures within the Area of
    Effect of a Trait. There is no distinction between Friend and Foe within an
    AoE. You may combine Range with Area of Effect so that the Area of Effect
    spreads outward from a chosen point within its Range. 

    The shape of an AoE is decided at Trait Creation, it is locked into that
    shape until the Trait is upgraded, where the existing AoE shape may be added
    to, but not subtracted from. The Point of Origin may begin at any point
    adjascent to the Traits owner if the Trait has no Range.
    
    Alternatively, the Point of Origin can occupy the same square as the Trait's
    owner if that is desired, however this would cause the Trait's owner to
    contend with the effects of the Trait whenever it is activated.  

### CORE DAMAGE 
#### COST: 2 EXO per 1 point of Core Damage
    
    This value is used to determine the penalty applied to a Capacity of a target
    Creature once it interacts with the Trait/its products. Core Damage must be
    accompanied by Damage or Integrity if you want it to apply through conscious
    resistance from the Target. An afflicted Creature may not necessarily be
    aware they are affected by Core Damage until they actively Attempt to use a
    Core if the Trait does not also cause Damage, unless the Player has decided
    they have wanted it to do so at all times.

    If a single Core of a Creature is reduced to -5, that Creature can only
    preform 1 Action per Round/Moment, and if two Cores are reduced to -5, that
    Creature is Incapacitated, meaning that it can perform no Actions. Vitals
    are not affected by changes to their Core.

### CORE BOOST
#### COST: 4 EXO per 1 point of Core Boost
    
    This value represents by how many points you may Raise a Target's designated
    Core by. If this effect is applied, the Creature's Vitals are *not* changed.
    Boost must be shared amongst Creatures within the Traits AoE if it has AoE.
    Core Boost radiates outward from the Point of Origin, being divided equally
    if possible, but with the nearest Creature receiving any remainder, up to a
    maximum of +5. Creatures may not have a Core boosted beyond what is allowed
    by its Capacity (5 by default). 

    That is, if you possess a Trait that has +1 Core Boost and has a 20ft AoE,
    only the Creature nearest to the Point of Origin will receive the Core
    Boost. Core Boost lasts for a number of rounds equivalent to the Traits
    Integrity (or at least until the end of the boosted Creature's Turn) after
    which it must be reapplied with an Action. Core Boost is not generic, you
    must specify which Core it boosts when you purchase it.

### CONCEALMENT (~)
#### COST: 1 EXO
    
    A Trait with this property is not discernible at a glance. In order to
    discover a Concealed Trait, a Creature must either have a specialized tool
    that explicitly detects some aspect of the Concealed Trait, or otherwise the
    inspecting Creature is able to freely touch and grope the Creature, as if
    frisking them. This protects the Trait from detection if neither of the
    above criteria are met. If one has multiple Traits, Concealment must be
    purchased for each seperate Trait.  While the Trait is being activated/used,
    it loses the benefit of Concealment. Purchasing Concealment twice makes the
    Trait completely inperceivable by the naked eye. A DNA Analysis would need
    to be performed to determine the existence the of the Trait without
    otherwise having seen it being used.


### INTEGRITY 
#### COST: 2 EXO per 1 Integrity
    
    All properties of a Trait (Damage, Core Damage, Core Boost) will be
    reapplied to the Target(s)/AoE at the beginning of every Round until the
    Trait's products are reduced to an Integrity of 0.

    If a Trait has even 1 point of Integrity, it implies that it produces some
    tangible material that persists in the Game World until it is
    destroyed/dispersed by oppossing forces. 

    The Integrity of a Trait's products are reduced by 1 whenever they are
    Challenged, but the Integrity is reduced to 0 if they are overcome by an
    oppossing Challenge. The Trait's products are destroyed and rendered useless
    if its Integrity is reduced to 0. Traits with constructive properties like
    Core Boost automatically lose 1 point of Integrity at the beginning of every
    round. 

    You must designate the product's Form as either gas, liquid, or
    solid. Creatures are able to interact with any substances with Integrity in
    ways that makes sense given its Form and other aesthetics.

    A Trait's products may also be used as improvized tools to complete a
    Challenge, and in these cases the Integrity is reduced by 1 whenever they
    are used. The shape and size of a Trait's products are set at Trait
    Creation, and cannot be changed at will. 

    Something with Integrity has Momentum equivalent to its Integrity unless it
    is a gas, in which case the Momentum is capped at 0. Reducing Intergrity
    does not reduce the Momentum of the products.

    If the Trait is reapplied to space occupied by its products before their
    Integrity is depleted, the Integrity is refreshed not added to. Traits with
    Integrity may be set as traps in ways that make sense for its given Form.
    Traps laid in this way require a Sense Challenge equivalent to Activation
    Challenge performed by the owner in order to detect it. 

### EFFECT CHALLENGE (EC)
#### COST: 2 EXO / 3 EC

    In addition to the other primary effects of the Trait (i.e. Damage or Core
    Damage), you are able to assign the product of your Trait an Effect. This
    Effect is any Challenge your Character would normally be able to preform,
    but instead, it is treated as if it produced the Attempt score equivalent to
    the assigned Effect Challenge. You must designate exactly what the Effect
    entails, however the Effect cannot directly Damage or Injure the Target.

    For example, a Character may have a Trait that allows it to shoot a string
    of web of Integrity 2 out by 30ft. If this Trait was also given a
    Brawn-based Effect Challenge of 6 that's intended to allow the web to "grab"
    onto any surface it touches, the web would be treated as if it just
    completed a Brawn Challenge with an Attempt of 4 whenever it does encounter
    a surface. This same Trait could potentially be used as tool to Trip fleeing
    Creatures, or snatch weapons out of the hands of assailants if they are
    unaware.

    The Form of a Trait are taken into account by the GM when they decide
    the Challenge required for the Effect to succeed, just as they do when they
    determine Challenge Difficulty for Characters in possession of tools. Effect
    Challenges do not reduce the Integrity of a Trait's products when it
    activates.

### HEALTH REPLENISHMENT (HR)
#### COST: 2 EXO / 1 HR
    
    This value represents how much Health of a Target may be replenished if the
    Effect of the Trait is applied. You normally will not have to overcome a
    Challenge in order to apply Health Replenishment, but in certain
    circumstances (e.g. the Character you want to heal is currently grappled by
    an enemy) the GM may ask you to perform a Challenge to see if you apply the
    replenishment to the correct Creature.

    If a Character has Injuries of level 2 or lower (Injury II and Injury I
    respectively), receiving Health Replenishment either partially or completely
    removes them. An Injury II requires 2 HR to be completely healed, but can be
    downgraded to a Injury I with 1 HR. Likewise, a Injury I is completely
    healed with 1 HR. Injuries are healed in the order that the Healer chooses.
    Health Replenishments may also be ueed to replenish expended Stamina
    instead. 
 
    Buying HR implies you are adding to a HR Pool with which you may dole out at
    your discretion. 1 Point of HR is replenished per hour of Break Time
    assuming that a Creature has met its nutritional requirements. 

ANATOMY MUTATIONS
-----------------

### BONUS ARMOR
#### COST: 2 EXO per 2 Armor Points 

    You are able to purchase Bonus Armor for your Character. When doing so you
    gain Armor Points that you may spend on a Trait as if you were Crafting
    Armor. Refer to the Crafting Armor Section for a thorough explanation on how
    to apply AP points to your Trait. Examples of Traits with Bonus Armor are
    available in the Trait Index.

### BONUS DODGE
#### COST: 2 EXO per 1 Bonus Dodge 

    You Creature's Active / Natural Dodge Attempts are increased by the amount
    of Bonus Dodge a Trait has.

### BONUS HANDS
#### COST: 2 EXO per Hand 
    
    Typically Creatures have two "hands" that they can wield items with in a
    Combat Scenario. All Creatures are considered ambidextrous for all
    Challenges. Gaining an extra Hand allows you to simultaneously wield 3
    1-Handed Weapons at a time (or some combination of 2-Handed Weapons and
    1-Handed Weapons). Gaining more than 1 Hand allows for a larger variety of
    weapon combinations. Despite there name, Hands do not have to be actual
    hands. Like all Traits, the details of their aesthetics is between you and
    your table-mates. As always, the Creature needs to account for the Momentum
    of the Weapons he is holding with any Hand.

### SENSE ENHANCEMENT
#### COST: 2 EXO per 3 Sense Points

    You are able to enhance your Senses with either direct Attempt Bonuses, or
    unique sight enhancments that broaden the spectrum of what and how your
    Character can perceive the Game World.

    This system is described within the Physiology section of this book. Amongst
    other things, you can 

### REACH
#### COST: 3 EXO per +5ft of Reach 
    
    Reach refers to how far away from something a Creature can be and still
    adeptly interact with it. Typically, a Creature is able to interact with
    anything that is adjascent (within 5ft) to it, but having Reach increases
    this radius, similar to Dextrous Range, except Reach applies to all existing
    Hands a Creature has. This implicitely increases the range of weapons. Some
    items will have Reach requirements, meaning that unless you possess a Trait
    with the specified amount of Reach, you will not be able to use it. 

### RESIZE 
#### COST: 3 EXO per Size Category  
    
    There are 3 Size Categories that Player Characters can be created under.
    From smallest to largest they are:

    Small   
    Medium  
    Big     

    Each size has various properties that alter your Character's baseline
    physiology. These alternations are not all beneficial. Each Size Category is
    explained in detail in the Physiology section.

### CORE ENHANCEMENT
#### COST: 5 EXO per Core Enhancement
    
    This value represents how many points you may raise a Core of your Creature by.
    Core Enhancment does not synergize with any other Trait property. Unlike Core
    Boost, Core Enhancement *does* enhance the Vitals of the owner. Core Enhancement 
    are constant, and persist even while the Traits owner is unconscious. Core
    Enhancement may not be higher than its associated Capacity.

STEP 3) WHAT IS THE ACTIVATION COST OF THE TRAIT?
=================================================

Anatomy Mutations are alternations that fundamentally alter the foundation of
your Anatomy. On the other hand, Natural Weapons build off of pre-existing
physiology, and almost always involve creating additional material in order to
apply effects or otherwise utilizing specialized limbs. 

There are additional costs associated with using Natural Weapons. Natural
Weapons are given a Power Level, which is equal to its (EXO / 10)^. Every time a
Natural Weapon is used, in addition to the Cards discarded normally, you will also need
to discard 1 additional Card per Power Level. 

This means if you used 20 EXO to build a Trait, using that Trait forces you to
discard a total of 3 Cards every time it is used; 1 for the Action itself, and 2
because of the Trait's Power Level.
