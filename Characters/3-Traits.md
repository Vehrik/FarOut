TRAITS
======

    At Character Creation you are given 3 Splice Points points, however, applying them to
    your Character is optional. You may defer their application to a later time, or
    decide not to use them at all.
    
    At Level 1, you may optionally exchange 1 Slant in order to gain 2 Splice Points Points.
    You may make this exchange up to 3 times during Character creation. After
    this time, you must have the appropriate amount of Prestige and Credit in
    order to gain additional Splice Points points in the form of Items, Equipment and
    Mutations.
    
    Splice Points may be exchanged for anything from to fangs, to AI-designed martial arts, to
    acid breath, to wrist mounted laser cannons. 
    
    Whatever your Trait is, it represents a change to your character's appearance
    that is either mechanical or biological that warrants the effect it grants you.

    If your character able to reach out and touch someone 30ft away, for
    example, it means something along the lines of your character is able to
    shoot web, it has a tentacle arm, or it has a shoulder mounted harpoon. The
    exact description of a Trait depends on the Character's back-story, the
    'function' of the Trait and the narrative context of the game you are
    playing.

    Your Trait is bound by its Properties and Aesthetics. The Properties inform the
    Aesthetics which inform the Narrative. In other words, Traits won't be able to
    influence the "Meta Game" (creature statistics like Health, Stride, Reach, etc)
    more than is defined by their Properties, but the resulting Aesthetics may allow
    for creative applications or unforeseen consequences within the Narrative.

    Whatever your Trait ends up being you must decide on the following three
    details:

            1. The location of the Trait. You may designate the Trait as being
               anchored to or embedded in either your Torso, Head, or one of
               your Limbs. Multiple Traits may be anchored to/embedded in the
               same portion of your body. Traits may become less effective or
               even unuseable if the body part the Trait is associated with
               becomes Injured. You may optionally designate the Trait as a
               Crux, giving your 3 additional Splice Points points to use on the
               Crux, but if the Crux is damaged, it could Fail Catastrophically.

            2. The material the Trait is made of. A Trait may be comprised of
               either Metal, Biomass or Energy or some combination thereof. It
               will influence to what degree certain hazards will effect your
               Character. Each category of material will also incur one of the
               following bonuses based on which material the Trait is *mostly*
               comprised of:
                    
                        Metal - You gain +1 point of Natural Defense and the
                        limb automatically qualifies as a Crude Weapon as a
                        Damage of 1 and a Range of 0. You may expand upon this
                        Damage if you make the Trait Crude as well, but you may
                        also create a Technical Trait and have it double as a
                        improvised Crude Weapon.

                        Biomass - As long as the Trait is not a Crux, the Player
                        may choose to have the Trait to be Concealed with no
                        additional Splice Point Cost. Damaged Traits may be
                        forced to work as normal by expending 2 Stamina for a
                        single use. You may also expend 2 Stamina in order to
                        force a Disabled Biomass Trait to work for a single use
                        as if it were merely Damaged. 

                        Energy - The Trait gains a Range of 1 and 1 Point of
                        Damage for no additional cost. If you give the Trait
                        Volume, it automatically gains +5v3 on the first 5v3
                        bought.

            3. The general dimensions of the Trait. You don't need to have the
               measurements down to the inch, but you need a solid concept of
               whether the shoulder mounted flamethrower means you're adding 3
               seperate wine-bottle sized cynlinders onto your upper arm, or if
               you're carrying what amounts to a back-pack filled with jet fuel
               on your back. This mass isn't anymore vulnerable than any other
               part of the body unless the Trait is also a Crux, in which case
               you need to carefully considered how to distribute the mass of
               your Trait. While not meant to be exact, the general guideline
               for a Splice Points to Volume relationship is 1 litre of
               distilled water to 1 Splice Point spent.

STEP 1) HOW MANY TRAITS?
========================

    Whether or not you take a Trait at all should be carefully considered. While they
    are undoubtedly useful, Traits incur a financial and practical consideration for you
    Character. 
    
    The bodies of Creatures can only handle so much Mutation before it starts to
    stress existing body systems. At level 1, for every 4 Splice Points used, their
    Character's Stamina decreases by 1. At every odd level of Prestige (3, 5, 7,
    and 9), this threshold is increased by 2 point. 

    Every 5 Splice Point spent adds 1 point of Burden to your Character.
    
    You may have more than one Trait at once.

STEP 2) WHAT PROPERTIES WILL THE TRAIT(S) HAVE?
===============================================

There are two types of Traits, Natural Weapons and Anatomy Mutations.

NATURAL WEAPONS
---------------

### DAMAGE(D)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points / 1 D
    
    This value is used to determine the Damage dealt by this Trait OR its
    products whenever it contacts a Creature. You must decide on the first point
    of Damage bought whether the Trait deals damage with projectiles or by
    virtue of its form (Crude or Technical respectively). This Damage can only
    be applied through use of the Trait directly. It may either be Force, Fire,
    Frost, Poison, or Electric. Damage automatically becomes Ranged Damage if
    the Trait also has Range, but otherwise you must specifiy it as Crude or
    Technical. As with all Crude items, it cannot benefit from more than 1 Zone
    of Range.

### RANGE (R)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points / 3 Zones

    This value determines how many Zones away your Trait's missiles are able to
    feasibly harm your Target. This is seperate from determining if you actually
    hit your Target, this value is used to determine if you can even try. If
    your Trait has less than 9 Zones of Range, it implies it produces Slow
    projectiles. If this is the case, you may intentionally Bust on your next
    use of the Trait in order to double the Range for that use.

    Purchasing Range for Crude Traits only grants 1 Zone of Range but still
    costs 1 Splice Point.

### VOLUME (V)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points / 5 Cubic Feet (v3)

    Products of this Trait are formed at any point adjascent to or on
    the Character that possess this Trait. Once this point is chosen, it is
    fixed unless Spliced. The length up to which the product may Travel is
    equivalent to the Range property of the Trait. 

    When 5 Cubic Feet are bought, you are free to shape the Volume is a way that
    makes most sense for you intentions, but the length, width and volume will
    always be treated as if they were incremented by 5ft. If desired, you may
    purchase and store Volume to integrate into the Trait at a later time, but
    you need to get Spliced to do so. 

    You may split the Volume between multiple projectiles, but the Damage of the
    Trait must be split such that each projectile has at least 1 point of
    Damage/Capacity Damage. Each projectiles implies a single object with which
    the Damage or Capacity Damage properties will apply to whatever it touches
    and be rendered unusable on impact.

    Having an Integrity property leads to the missile being left whole on impact
    unless it is intentionally destroyed. The Trait's Products have an Momentum
    equivalent to that of the Integrity, but additional Momentum can be bought
    as well. The Product's Break Difficulty is equivalent to its Integrity +
    Momentum of the Trait.

    There will always be sufficient forensic information leftover to determine
    the type of weapon used and to match the damage to your Trait if they were
    to be able to test both.

### INTEGRITY 
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 1 Integrity
    
    All properties of a Trait (Damage, Capacity Damage, Core Boost) will be
    reapplied to the Target(s)/Volume at the beginning of every Round until the
    Trait's products are reduced to an Integrity of 0.

    If a Trait has even 1 point of Integrity, it implies that it produces some
    tangible material that persists in the Game World until it is
    destroyed/dispersed by oppossing forces. Volume implies the same, but
    without integrity the product evaporates into nothingness almost immediately
    after it applies its effects

    The Integrity of a Trait's products are reduced by 1 whenever they are
    Challenged, but the Integrity is reduced to 0 if they are overcome by an
    oppossing Challenge. The Trait's products are destroyed and rendered useless
    if its Integrity is reduced to 0. Traits with constructive properties like
    Core Boost automatically lose 1 point of Integrity at the beginning of every
    round. 

    You must designate the product's Form as either gas, liquid, or
    solid. Creatures are able to interact with any substances with Integrity in
    ways that makes sense given its Form and other aesthetics.

    A Trait's products may also be used as improvized tools to complete a
    Challenge, and in these cases the Integrity is reduced by 1 whenever they
    are used. The shape, texture, hardness, and size of a Trait's products are
    set at Trait Creation, and cannot be changed at will. If a Trait is used to
    complete a Challenge higher than its Integrity, it breaks.

    Something with Integrity has Momentum equivalent to its Integrity + Trait
    Momentum unless it is a gas, in which case the Momentum is capped at 0.
    Reducing Intergrity does not reduce the Momentum of the products.

    If the Trait is reapplied to space occupied by its products before their
    Integrity is depleted, the Integrity is added to and stacks up to a value of
    15. Products and the mode by which they are produced are treated as
    reasonably as the GM is prepared to honor. The products nor the mode of
    production cannot cause stat damage at all unless you have decided that it
    is explicitely what causes damage as far as Aesthetics are concerned.

    Traits with Integrity may be set as traps in ways that make sense for its
    given Form. Traps laid in this way require a Sense Challenge equivalent to
    the Brain Challenge performed by the trapper when they set the trap to
    detect it. 

### CAPACITY DAMAGE 
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 1 point of Capacity Damage
    
    This value is used to determine the penalty applied to a Capacity of a
    target Creature once it interacts with the Trait/its products. Capacity
    Damage must be accompanied by Damage or Integrity if you want it to apply
    through conscious resistance from the Target. 

    An afflicted Creature may not necessarily be aware they are affected by
    Capacity Damage until they actively Attempt to use a Core if the Trait does
    not also cause Damage, unless the Player inflicting Capacity Damage has
    decided they have wanted it to cause sensory effects at all times.

    If a single Core of a Creature is reduced to -5, that Creature incurs 1
    point of Action Debt, and if two Cores are reduced to -5, the Creature is
    Incapacitated and can perform no willing Actions or Reaction. Vitals are
    not affected by changes to their Core by Core Damage.

    If a Creature suffers from -10 Capacity Damage at once, they fall
    unconscious. 

    Capacity Damage is not generic, you must designate which Capacity each point
    of Capacity Damage is being applied to.

### CORE BOOST
#### COST: 4 Splice Points per 1 point of Core Boost
    
    This value represents by how many points you may Raise a Target's designated
    Core by. If this effect is applied, the Creature's Vitals are changed.
    Boost must be shared amongst Creatures within the Traits Volume if it has Volume.
    Core Boost radiates outward from the Point of Origin, being divided equally
    if possible, but with the nearest Creature receiving any remainder, up to a
    maximum of +5. Creatures may not have a Core boosted beyond what is allowed
    by its Capacity (5 by default). 

    That is, if you possess a Trait that has +1 Core Boost and has a 20ft Volume,
    only the Creature nearest to the Point of Origin will receive the Core
    Boost. Core Boost lasts for a number of rounds equivalent to the Traits
    Integrity (or at least until the end of the boosted Creature's Turn) after
    which it must be reapplied with an Action. Core Boost is not generic, you
    must specify which Core it boosts when you purchase it.

    Core Boost does not penalize the associated Core of the one you're boosting.
    In other words, if you Boosted your Brawn by +2, your Speed would not be
    drained by -2. Reapplying Core Boost from the same source only refreshes the
    duration as opposed to adding to the Boost.

    Multiple sources of Core Boost do add together, but they cannot be Boosted
    to have a Core that's greater than +5.

### CONCEALMENT (~)
#### COST: 1 Splice Points
    
    A Trait with this property is not discernible at a glance. In order to
    discover a Concealed Trait, a Creature must either have a specialized tool
    that explicitly detects some aspect of the Concealed Trait, or otherwise the
    inspecting Creature is able to freely touch and grope the Creature, as if
    frisking them. This protects the Trait from detection if neither of the
    above criteria are met. 

    If one has multiple Traits, Concealment must be purchased for each seperate
    Trait. While the Trait is being activated/used, it loses the benefit of
    Concealment. Purchasing Concealment twice makes the Trait completely
    inperceivable by the naked eye. A DNA Analysis would need to be performed to
    determine the existence the of the Trait without otherwise having seen it
    being used.

    The Cost of concealing a Crux is double.

### EFFECT CHALLENGE (EC)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points / 3 EC

    In addition to the other primary effects of the Trait (i.e. Damage or Core
    Damage), you are able to assign the product of your Trait an Effect. This
    Effect is any Challenge your Character would normally be able to preform,
    but instead, it is treated as if it produced the Attempt score equivalent to
    the assigned Effect Challenge. You must designate exactly what the Effect
    entails, however the Effect cannot directly Damage or Injure the Target by
    virtue of itself.

    For example, a Character may have a Trait that allows it to shoot a string
    of web of Integrity 2 out by 6 Zones. If this Trait was also given a
    Brawn-based Effect Challenge of 6 that's intended to allow the web to grab
    onto any surface it touches, the web would be treated as if it just
    completed a Brawn Challenge with an Attempt of 6 whenever it does encounter
    a surface. This same Trait could potentially be used as tool to Trip fleeing
    Creatures, or snatch weapons out of the hands of assailants if they are
    unaware.

    The Form of a Trait are taken into account by the GM when they decide
    the Challenge required for the Effect to succeed, just as they do when they
    determine Challenge Difficulty for Characters in possession of tools. Effect
    Challenges do not reduce the Integrity of a Trait's products when it
    activates.

    There are Forms that are considered "too good" to be allowed. Where this
    line is almost entirely up to the GM as they have the final say regardless
    of the text in this document. That said, as a rule of thumb it shouldn't
    physically morph the environment passively, nor should it be potent enough
    to cause Injury passively. Additionally, 

### HEALTH REPLENISHMENT (HR)
#### COST: 2 Splice Points / 1 HR
    
    This value represents how much Health of a Target may be replenished if the
    Effect of the Trait is applied. You normally will not have to overcome a
    Challenge in order to apply Health Replenishment, but in certain
    circumstances (e.g. the Character you want to heal is currently grappled by
    an enemy) the GM may ask you to perform a Challenge to see if you apply the
    replenishment to the correct Creature.

    If a Character has Injuries of level 2 or lower (Injury II and Injury I
    respectively), receiving Health Replenishment either partially or completely
    removes them. An Injury II requires 2 HR to be completely healed, but can be
    downgraded to a Injury I with 1 HR. Likewise, a Injury I is completely
    healed with 1 HR. Injuries are healed in the order that the Healer chooses.
    Health Replenishments may also be ueed to replenish expended Stamina
    instead. 
 
    Buying HR implies you are adding to a HR Pool with which you may dole out at
    your discretion. 1 Point of HR is replenished per hour of Break Time
    assuming that a Creature has met its nutritional requirements. 

ANATOMY MUTATIONS
-----------------

### BONUS ARMOR
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 1 Armor Points 

    You are able to purchase Bonus Armor for your Character. When doing so you
    gain Armor Points that you may spend on a Trait as if you were Crafting
    Armor. Refer to the Crafting Armor Section for a thorough explanation on how
    to apply AP points to your Trait. Examples of Traits with Bonus Armor are
    available in the Trait Index.

### BONUS NATURAL DEFENSE
#### COST: 1 Splice Points per 1 Bonus Natural Defense 

    You Creature's Natural Dodge Attempts are increased by the amount
    of Bonus Dodge a Trait has, but other effects of increased Natural Defense
    (higher Fall Damage and stronger Unarmed Strikes) also apply. 

### BONUS HANDS
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per Hand 
    
    Typically Creatures have two "hands" that they can wield items with in a
    Combat Scenario. All Creatures are considered ambidextrous for all
    Challenges. Gaining an extra Hand allows you to simultaneously wield 3
    1-Handed Weapons at a time (or some combination of 2-Handed Weapons and
    1-Handed Weapons). Gaining more than 1 Hand allows for a larger variety of
    weapon combinations. Despite there name, Hands do not have to be actual
    hands. Like all Traits, the details of their aesthetics is between you and
    your table-mates. As always, the Creature needs to account for the Momentum
    of the Weapons he is holding with any Hand.

### SENSE ENHANCEMENT
#### COST: 2 Splice Points per 3 Sense Points

    You are able to enhance your Senses with either direct Attempt Bonuses, or
    unique sight enhancments that broaden the spectrum of what and how your
    Character can perceive the Game World.

    This system is described within the Physiology section of this book. Amongst
    other things, you can gain the ability to see in the dark, or sense
    the heart beats of other Creatures.

### RESIZE 
#### COST: 3 Splice Points per Size Category  
    
    There are 3 Size Categories that Player Characters can be created under.
    From smallest to largest they are:

    Small   
    Medium  
    Big     

    Each size has various properties that alter your Character's baseline
    physiology. These alternations are not all beneficial. Each Size Category is
    explained in detail in the Physiology section.

DAMAGED TRAITS
==============

Traits aren't just balls of numbers that you tap your finger on to make the bad
guys go away. They're relics of your Characters story AND features on your
Character's anatomy. A Character more than likely sees there Trait as a part of
their body or at least as a important item that deserves respect. Regardless,
you will more than likely damage your Trait.

Traits have a chance to become Damaged whenever the limb their attached
to/housed within become Damaged. It depends on how hard the hit was, but a
Damaged Trait can be either Malfunctioning or Disabled.

Using a Malfunctioning Trait incurs a Bust whenever you are using it. A Disabled
Trait cannot be used at all.
