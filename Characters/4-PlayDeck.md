Challenges
==========

Every time your Character attempts to do something that has meaningful, unwanted
consequences associated with failure, they are said to be Attempting a Challenge.

In order to Attempt a Challenge, the GM first determines which Core of the
Character is being Challenged. Almost always this is easily decided, but
occasionally the GM will ask you to elaborate on *how* your Character is going
about the task in order to get a clearer picture on which Core your Character is
using.

Every Challenge has a Difficulty associated with it. The GM is responsible for
gauging how difficult a Challenge should be given the Context. 

The Context refers to what is going on currently within the Game World. This
includes things like your Creature's biology, what tools they have at their
disposal and the nature of the Challenge itself.

When you Attempt a Challenge you need to generate an Attempt. This is done by
drawing at least 1 Card from the Play Deck.

The Play Deck is a standard deck of playing cards including the 2 Jokers. It
contains 54 Cards in total, 2 Jokers (1 Red and 1 Black) plus 13 cards each for
4 Suits (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds). 

Half the Suits are Red (Hearts and Diamonds) and half are Black (Clubs and
Spades). Each Color corresponds with one of the 2 Character Capacities. Black is
linked to the Body Capacity, whereas the Red is associated with the Soul
Capacity. Each player and the GM needs their own Play Deck. 

Ideally, they are high-quality, durable playing cards with the Suits
distinguished by both colour and symbol, but low-budget decks can be made out of
readily available materials in a pinch.

When you Attempt a Challenge, you draw the top card from your Play Deck. The value
on the card (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack(11), Queen(12), King(13), Ace(14||1),
Joker(15||0)) is added to the value of the corresponding Core of your Character.

The numbered cards (2 through 10) have a value equivalent to their number.
Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 11, 12, and 13 respectively. Aces and Jokers
are special. If you draw an Ace, if it is of the correct colour, it is
equivalent to 14, but if it is the wrong colour, it is equivalent to a 1. 

If you draw a Joker, if it is the wrong colour, it is worth 0, and you
automatically Bust for your next Turn, but if it is the correct colour, it is
worth 15, and you automatically Bang II during your next Action. A colour is
"correct" if you are using the colour of its associated Core (Black for Speed
and Brawn, Red for Brain and Heart).

So for example, if you were Attempting a Brawn or Speed based Challenge and drew
a Black Ace (either Ace of Clubs or Ace of Spades), it would be valued at 14. If
you draw a Red Ace (either Ace of Hearts or Ace of Diamonds), it would be valued
at 1 instead. Jokers follow this same logic, but resolve to be either 0 on a bad
colour or 15 on a good colour.

As discussed in the Cores and Capacities Section, when your Character is faced
with a Challenge, you combine the Card's face value with the Challenges
associated Core.

This number is your Attempt Score. Having an Attempt Score greater than or equal
to the Challenge's Difficulty results in an increasing degree of success. Falling
short results in failure, with increasingly severe punishments the more points
you fail by.

Exactly what happens when resolving a Challenge is up to your GM's
interpretation of the Context and what your Attempt Score ends up being compared
to the Challenge's Difficulty. It also depends on how you describe your
Character's movement and intent while completing a Challenge.

BANGS & BUSTS
-------------

There will be many times during your adventures that you will find yourself in
either advantageous or disadvantageous positions. Instances like these are
called Bangs and Busts. 

When you are in an advantageous position for the Challenge you are Attempting,
you are considered to have a Bang and to be "Banging". You can also be in positions
that are *so* advantageous that you may have a Double or Triple Bang.

When you have a Bang, you may peek at the top card of the deck, revealing its
value *before* it is used for a Challenge. If you have a Double Bang (Bang II),
you reveal 2 cards instead, and if you have a Triple Bang (Bang III), you reveal
3 cards instead.

You must play these Cards in the order they appear, as you normally would,
however knowing what cards are available to you gives you an immense upper-hand.

Your GM is the only person at the table that can hand Bangs out, but there are
some mechanics within the game that explicitly grant Bangs, and if these
mechanics somehow overlap, you can potentially end up with a Double or Triple
Bang without your GM having to explicitly give you one.

When you are in a disadvantageous position for a Challenge you are Attempting,
you get given a Bust, and are considered to be "Busted". If you are Busted, you
are unable to Double or Triple Down. 

Unlike Bangs, there is no such thing as being Double or Triple Busted. You're
Busted until you remove whatever factor is causing you to Bust. You
automatically stop being Busted at the end of a Round, but nothing is stopping
you from getting Busted immediately at the start of the next round should you
still be in a disadvantageous position.

Your GM is the only person at the table that can hand Busts out, but there are
some mechanics within the game that explicitly cause Busts.

TAKING RISKS AND RAISING STAKES
-------------------------------

There will be times where you just can't afford to fail a particular Challenge,
but the card you draw is not the one you think you need. In an instance like this, you can
do one of two things:

    1. Pray that the GM will take mercy on you.

    2. Double Down

Doubling Down means that you can draw one more Card and add its value to
whatever your Attempt Score was initially. So for example, you want your
Character to catch the arm of a falling comrade, but you draw an 8, but you have
a -1 Speed Core. 

You're fairly positive that an Attempt of 7 isn't going to be enough, so you
declare you're Doubling Down. You then draw another Card, a 6 in this case,
which brings the Attempt up to 13, which *should* be enough.

Tripling Down is just Doubling Down on a Double Down. So in the previous
example, you drew a 2 instead of a 6. You want something higher than a 9, so you
take the risk and Triple Down. 

You then draw another Card and add that value to the card drawn when you Doubled
Down AND the card you initially drew when you took the first Action as well as
your relevant Core. Say you drew a 4 when you Doubled Down, then a 3 when you
Tripled Down, you would end up with a total Attempt of 14.

You must decide to Double Down or Triple Down *before* your GM reveals whether
or not your Attempt succeeded or not.

Be careful, because if you Double Down or Triple Down, but fail anyways, you'll
end up Staggered or Flat Footed. 

If you fail a Challenge you Doubled Down on, you get Staggered. When Staggered,
you automatically Bust for your next Turn and in addition, any Creature that
targets you automatically gets a Bang I for the Action taken against your
Character. 

If you fail a Challenge you Triple Down on, you become Flat Footed, which means
you automatically Bust for your next turn, and in addition, any Creature that
targets you automatically gets a Bang II for the Action taken against your
Character.

Being Staggered and Flat Footed happens in addition to whatever happens as a
result of you failing the Challenge.

In addition to the dangers associated with being Staggered and Flat Footed, you
can Flop. If the total of the 3 Cards you drew is higher than 15, you Flop and
you are treated as if you *only* drew the first card that you initially decided
to Double or Triple Down on. 

If you draw a Joker when you Double or Triple Down, you automatically Flop.

GRUNTING
--------

Grunting means that your Character pushed their body to its limits for a
short amount of time in order to gain the upper-hand in a situation.
Grunting costs Stamina, and can be used to generate one of the following
effects:

    1. Reach For It 

        1>>2 Stamina 

        If you are Busted, you may expend 1 Stamina to Double Down despite being
        Busted. You may Triple Down for 1 more additional Stamina.

    2. Heartseeker 

        1>>3 Stamina 

        You may expend 1 point of Stamina in order to Bang. You may Double Bang
        for 2 Stamina, and Triple Bang for 3.

    3. Grit Your Teeth

        1>>? Stamina

        When you receive Damage, the moment before it is deducted from your
        Strikes, you may may expend 1 Stamina to reduce it by half rounded down.
        You may do this as many times as you like, but you may not reduce damage
        to a value lower than 1.

    4. Knuckle Down 

        2 Stamina 

        After you fail a Challenge, you may decide to expend 2 points of Stamina
        in order to retry the Challenge. If you succeed this time, you were
        treated as you succeeded for the initial Attempt. If you Knuckle Down on
        a Double or Triple Down, you may only retry for the last card drawn.

    5. Fast Reaction 

        2 Stamina 

        Reactions are usually resolved *after* the Action you are Reacting to.
        Fast Reactions, on the other hand, resolve *while* the Action you're
        Reacting to is resolving, meaning you can potentially interrupt Actions
        before they have their effects applied. When you declare that you are
        Reacting to something, you may also declare that you are performing a
        Fast Reaction and expend the 2 points of Stamina.

    6. Frenzy 

        2 Stamina 

        After you have used up your Action for a Round, you may expend Stamina
        in order to gain 1 additional Action for the Round. You may only do this
        once per Round.

BOONS
-----

As a reward for playing the game well, a GM may grant you a Boon. A
Boon can do one of three things:

            1. Grant your Character a Bang on their next Action.

            2. Nullify the effects of a Bust.

            3. Be gifted to another player. Doing so costs an Action from the
               Character who is gifting the Boon.

What is meant by "playing the game well" is really up to the GM, but typically
it would include things like reacting compellingly to situations, remaining in
Character consistently, abiding by the Virtues and Vices of your Character, or
otherwise improving the play experience for everyone (including the GM!). This
list is by no means exhaustive, and a GM is free to hand out Boons as they see
fit.

A Player can only be in possession of a single Boon at a time.
