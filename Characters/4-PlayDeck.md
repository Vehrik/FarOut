Challenges
==========

Every time your Character attempts to do something outside the realm of mundane
life, be it climbing a ladder, diving over moving vehicles, or feinting a sword
swipe, your GM will ask you to beat a Challenge of proportional Difficulty
depending what you're doing.

In order to Attempt a Challenge, the GM first determines which Core of the
Character is being challenged. Almost always this is easily decided, but
occasionally 

In order to properly utilize the Play Deck, you must grasp the following
concepts:

    Cores & Challenges
    Doubling Down, Tripling Down and Flopping.
    Bangs, Busts, and Boons

The Play Deck is a standard deck of playing cards including the 2 Jokers. It
contains 54 Cards in total, 2 Jokers (1 Red and 1 Black) plus 13 each of 4 Suits
(Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds). 

Half the Suits are Red (Hearts and Diamonds) and half are Black (Clubs and
Spades). Each Color corresponds with one of the 2 Character Capacities. Black is
linked to the Body Capacity, whereas the Red is associated with the Soul
Capacity. Each player and the GM needs their own personal Play Deck. 

Ideally, they are high-quality, durable playing cards with the Suits
distinguished by both colour and symbol, but low-budget decks can be made out of
readily available materials in a pinch.

When you Attempt a Challenge, you draw the top card from your Play Deck. The value
on the card (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack(11), Queen(12), King(13), Ace(14||1),
Joker(15||0)) is added to the value of the corresponding Core of your Character.

The numbered cards (2 through 10) have a value equivalent to their number.
Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 11, 12, and 13 respectively. Aces and Jokers
are special. If you draw an Ace, if it is of the correct colour, it is
equivalent to 14, but if it is the wrong colour, it is equivalent to a 1. 

If you draw a Joker, if it is the wrong colour, it is worth 0, and you
automatically Bust for your next Action, but if it is the correct colour, it is
worth 15, and you automatically Bang II during your next Action. A colour is
"correct" if you are using the colour of its associated Core (Black for Speed
and Brawn, Red for Brain and Heart).

So for example, if you were Attempting a Brawn or Speed based Challenge and drew
a Black Ace (either Ace of Clubs or Ace of Spades), it would be valued at 14. If
you draw a Red Ace (either Ace of Hearts or Ace of Diamonds), it would be valued
at 1 instead. Jokers follow this same logic, but resolve to be either 0 on a bad
colour or 15 on a good colour.

As discussed in the Cores and Capacities Section, when your Character is faced
with a Challenge, you combine the Card's face value with the Challenges
associated Core.

This number is your Attempt Score. Having an Attempt Score greater than or equal
to the Challenge's Difficulty results in an increasing degree of success. Falling
short results in failure, with increasingly severe punishments the more points
you fail by.

The GM is at sole discretion to determine the value of a Challenge's Difficulty,
but the following chart should loosely guide their decisions:


0>>5 -> Simple

        These are actions that most humans encounter at least once or twice a day
        that are still easily failed if you aren't paying attention. They would
        include running up a staircase, driving to work, or cooking a decent meal.

5>>9 -> Average

        These actions refer to those that average humans are capable of,
        especially if properly motivated. This includes doing your taxes, riding
        a bike, or putting together an impressive slideshow. 

10>>14 -> Above Average

        These actions refer to those that humans can only typically do
        consistently if they've practiced them. These actions aren't record
        setting, but most humans are not automatically capable of them without
        at least some effort. This includes ramming down a thick wooden door,
        climbing a mountain, or participating in a varsity chess tournament.

15>>19 -> Champion
        
        These actions refer to those that only highly talented humans are
        capable of doing consistently, but that are still able to be
        completed by average humans with a good deal of luck, preperation
        and/or stubborness. This includes walking across a thin wooden beam
        in a storm, fighting off a shark, or acing a college midterm.

20>>24 -> Hero

        These actions are extremely impressive ones that are beyond the realm
        of what the human anatomy is physically capable of. This includes things
        like bench-pressing cars, running across water like it were solid
        ground, or cracking an encrypted computer cypher. 

25 -> Super Hero 

        This is the very highest ability Characters are intended to reach without the
        assistance of sophisticated military hardware. Actions of this type include
        throwing cars like they're stones, running through buildings like they aren't
        even there, or cracking out massive turn-night-into-day lightning bolts.

Exactly what happens when resolving a Challenge is up to your GM's
interpretation of the Context and what your Attempt Score ends up being compared
to the Challenge's Difficulty. It also depends on how you describe your
Character's movement and intent while completing a Challenge.

DOUBLING DOWN, TRIPLING DOWN, & FLOPPING
----------------------------------------

There will be times where you just can't afford to fail a particular Challenge,
but the card you draw is not the one you think you need. In an instance like this, you can
do one of two things:

    1. Pray that the GM will take mercy on you.

    2. Double Down

Doubling Down means that you can draw one more Card and add its value to
whatever your Attempt Score was initially. So for example, you want your
Character to catch the arm of a falling comrade, but you draw an 8, but you have
a -1 Speed Core. You're fairly positive that an Attempt of 7 isn't going to be
enough, so you declare you're Doubling Down. You then draw another Card, a 6 in
this case, which brings the Attempt up to 13, which *should* be enough. Doubling
Down consumes an Action when you declare that you're doing it.

Tripling Down is just Doubling Down on a Double Down. So in the previous
example, you drew a 2 instead of a 6. You want something higher than a 9, so you
take the risk and Triple Down. You then draw another Card and add that value to
the card drawn when you Doubled Down AND the card you initially drew when you
took the first Action as well as your relevant Core. Say you drew a 4 when you
Doubled Down, then a 3 when you Tripled Down, you would end up with a total
Attempt of 14. Tripling Down consumes another Action when you declare you're
doing so.

You must decide to Double Down or Triple Down *before* your GM reveals whether
or not your Attempt succeeded or not.

Doubling Down and Tripling Down implies your Character takes riskier and riskier
measures while they are Attempting an Action. While ultimately up to the GM to
determine what exactly happens when you fail, failing an Action despite Doubling
or Tripling Down on it would normally cause worse and worse consequences to
unfold than if you just accepted the initial card the Play Deck gave you.

In addition to the lost Actions, you can Flop. If the total of the 3 Cards you
drew is higher than 15, you Flop and you are treated as if you *only* drew the
first card that you initially decided to Double or Triple Down on. 

If you draw a Joker when you Double or Triple Down, you automatically Flop.

BANGS & BUSTS
-------------

There will be many times during your adventures that you will find yourself in
either advantageous or disadvantageous positions. Instances like these are
called Bangs and Busts. 

When you are in an advantageous position for the Action you are Attempting, you
are considered to have a Bang and be "Banging". You can also be in positions
that are *so* advantageous that you may have a Double or Triple Bang.

When you have a Bang, you may peek at the top card of the deck, revealing its
value *before* it is used for an Action. If you have a Double Bang (Bang II), you reveal 2
cards instead, and if you have a Triple Bang (Bang III), you reveal 3 cards instead.

You must play these Cards in the order they appear, as you normally would,
however knowing what cards are available to you gives you an immense upper-hand in
combat.

Your GM is the only person at the table that can hand Bangs out, but there are
some mechanics within the game that explicitly grant Bangs, and if these
mechanics somehow overlap, you can potentially end up with a Double or Triple
Bang without your GM having to give you one.

When you are in a disadvantageous position for an Action you are Attempting, you
get given a Bust, and are considered to be "Busted". If you are Busted, you are
unable to Double or Triple Down. Unlike Bangs, there is no such thing as being
Double or Triple Busted. You're Busted until you remove whatever factor is
causing you to Bust. You automatically stop being Busted at the end of a Round,
but nothing is stopping you from Busting immediately at the start of the next
round should you still be in a disadvantageous position.

Your GM is the only person at the table that can hand Busts out, but there are
some mechanics within the game that explicitly cause Busts.

GRUNTING
--------

Grunting means that your Character pushed their body to its limits for a
short amount of time in order to gain the upper-hand in a situation.
Grunting costs Stamina, and can be used to generate one of the following
effects:

    1. Reach For It 

        1>>2 Stamina 

        If you are Busted, you may expend 1 Stamina to Double Down despite being
        Busted. You may Triple Down for 1 more additional Stamina.

    2. Heartseeker 

        1>>3 Stamina 

        You may expend 1 point of Stamina in order to Bang.  You may Double Bang
        for 2 Stamina, and Triple Bang for 3.

    3. Knuckle Down 

        2 Stamina 

        After you fail a Challenge, you may decide to expend 2 points of Stamina
        in order to retry the Challenge. If you succeed this time, you were
        treated as you succeeded for the initial Attempt. If you Knuckle Down on
        a Double or Triple Down, you may only retry for the last card drawn.

    4. Fast Reaction 

        2 Stamina 

        Reactions are usually resolved *after* the Action you are Reacting to.
        Fast Reactions, on the other hand, resolve *while* the Action is
        resolving, meaning you can potentially interrupt Actions before they
        resolve. When you declare that you are Reacting to something, you may
        also declare that you are performing a Fast Reaction and expend the 2
        points of Stamina.

    5. Frenzy 

        2 Stamina 

        After you have used up all 3 Actions for a Round, you may expend Stamina
        in order to gain 1 additional Action for the Round. You may only do this
        once per Round. You are *not* able to "Quadruple Down" with this Action,
        but you may use it to Double Down or Triple Down.


GETTING STAGGERED
-----------------

It's often tempting to throw all your Actions out at once to make something go
splat, but you need to be judicious with your Actions. During High Stress
Scenarios (usually this means a combat scenario, but can include things chasing
a bounty across rooftops, or zipping between buildings at Mach V), you have 3
Actions per round. 

These Actions can be triggered proactively in response to the Actions of other
Creatures' Actions, and when this is the case they are called Reactions. There
are also some Special Actions that can *only* be done in Reaction to some
trigger event. Both Reactions and Actions count as one of your 3 Actions per
Round. 

Being on the receiving end of a hostile Action can force you to Attempt a
Challenge, and in cases where you have used up all 3 Actions for the Round, you
are considered to be Staggered. When Staggered, every subsequent Attempt Score a
Creature generates is decreased by their Stagger Penalty.

When you initially become Staggered, you take a -1 Stagger Penalty to the next
Action you are forced to complete. This penalty doubles for every Action you
have to take while Staggered, up to a maximum of -16. After this point, you are
considered to be Flat Footed, and when you are Flat Footed, you automatically
fail any Action you are forced to Attempt.


BOONS
-----

As a reward for playing the game well, a GM may grant you a Boon. A
Boon can do one of three things:

            1. Grant your Character a Bang on their next Action.

            2. Nullify the effects of a Bust.

            3. Be gifted to another player. Doing so costs an Action from the
               Character who is gifting the Boon.

What is meant by "playing the game well" is really up to the GM, but typically
it would include things like reacting compellingly to situations, remaining in
Character consistently, abiding by the Virtues and Vices of your Character, or
otherwise improving the play experience for everyone (including the GM!). This
list is by no means exhaustive, and a GM is free to hand out Boons as they see
fit.

A Player can only be in possession of a single Boon at a time.
