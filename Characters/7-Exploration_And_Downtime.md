  CHAKRA AND STAMINA
  ==================

    Your Character is considered to have to reservoirs of "energy". One is
    accessed by taking short-breaks, whereas the other typically indicates a
    certain degree of desperation. They are known as Chakras, and are marked as
    either your Upper Chakra or your Lower Chakra.

    Whenever your Character attempts a Challenge, the card drawn from the Play
    Deck is placed into your Upper Chakra with its face pointing downward. This
    is the typical Card discarding motion. These cards are trapped in the Upper
    Chakra, unable to be used, until the Chakra is emptied by expending Stamina.
    
    You may either expend 1 point of Stamina or take a -1 penalty to a
    Core in order to move the cards in the Upper Chakra into the Play Deck, then
    shuffle the newly replenished Play Deck. 
    
    Additionally, you may expend 2 points of Stamina, take a -2 penalty to a Core, or a
    combination of both in order to place the Upper Chakra on the top of your Play Deck,
    then resume play *WITHOUT* shuffling the replenished Play Deck.
    
    You may expend Stamina At Will. This means you can do it during your Turn or
    anyone else's Turn during combat. You may choose to not expend Stamina, even in
    instances where it would lead to death for your Character.
    
    Some items, spells, narrative events, and environmental hazards Exhaust the
    Character. When Exhausted, before the Creature Attempts another Challenge, all
    Cards that were in the Character's Upper Chakra are placed into the Lower Chakra
    with their face pointing downward. While Exhausted, all discarded Cards go into
    your Lower Chakra.
    
    Cards in the Lower Chakra may be recovered in the same way you may recover cards
    in the Upper Chakra, but the Stamina/Core Penalty cost is doubled. Cards that
    fall into the Lower Chakra remain there until bought back with Stamina.
    
    Stamina is only recovered after a Rest assuming the Character's nutritional needs are
    met. Alternatively, a Character is able to take a Break and recover 13 Cards from the
    Upper Chakra per hour they Break for.
