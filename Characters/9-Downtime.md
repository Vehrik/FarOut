FOOD, FRIENDS, & FATIGUE
========================

Technology has come a long way, but humans haven't figured out how to produce
energy from nothing. You need to eat, and you need to replenish bodily
resources. Even if you're a robot, you need to run maintenance on your body and
replenish materials from time to time to keep your body in good repair.

Food is any resource that a Character can consume in order to replenish Stamina.
Food doesn't look the same for everybody, but every Character has to consume
*something*. At Character Creation, you choose between one of the following
Diets:


        Metal and Elbow Grease:

            You've replaced the vast majority of your body with metal and
            technology. You don't need to eat anymore, but you do have to
            occassionally repair yourself. These repairs generally cost about
            500 Credits / 1 Week of High Activity, and 500 Credits / Month of
            Low Acticity. While more expensive than food, when you Perform
            Maintenance, you immediately benefit from the maintenance after it
            is completed and you gain +2 Bonus Stamina after a Rest and +1 Bonus
            Stamina after a Break.


        Food and Fun:
            
            Like most living Creatures, you have to consume *something* produced
            by another living being. You need about 25 Credits worth of Rations
            every day of High Activity, but only 10 Credits worth of Rations
            every day of Low Activity. While it ends up being very costly to
            maintain a full month of High Activity, you probably won't have to
            sustain High Activity for a full month. You can eat food while
            taking a Break, and are considered to have immediately satisfied
            your hunger, but if you wait an extra hour you gain +1 Bonus Stamina
            when you exit the break.

            You can gain anywhere between 1-3 Bonus Stamina after a Rest,
            depending on the quality of food you ate during it. High quality
            food can get quite expensive, but your Characters are potentially
            able to produce it themselves. Below is a list of the relationship
            between food quality,
