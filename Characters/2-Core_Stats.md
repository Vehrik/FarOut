CORE STATS
==========

Your Cores are the ranking of your Character's mental and physical
attributes. They influence every Action your Character takes and helps the
GM decide whether your Character will succeed or fail Challenges and to what
extent. Choose your stats wisely, there are plenty of items/environmental
hazards that impart a "minimum requirement" for a certain Core. 

You can't be amazing at everything. Often times, achieving a higher Core
Value means making sacrifices, sometimes that could literally be an arm and
a leg. In a society where all but the most destitute and far-flung have been
genetically engineered so they are at the peak of what the human physiology
is capable of, the only way to gain meaningful advantages is to specialize.

Below each Stat is described for what facets of a creature it represents.
These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, and with clever
role-playing you can 'force' your GM to allow you to utilize a Core for
something it wouldn't normally be used for.

BRAWN
-----

    Brawn is a measure of your character's physical hardiness, physique and raw
    brute strength. Having a higher Brawn score allows your Character to dish
    out hard punches, ignore physical stress, and shoulder heavy burdens. Brawn
    also determines your Accuracy and Damage with Crude Weapons and Unarmed
    Attacks.

SPEED
-----
    
    Speed is a measure of how accurately and quickly your Character can move
    between and through obstacles. Having a higher Speed score indicates your
    character is fast moving, acrobatic and in possession of quick reflexes.
    Speed also determines your accuracy with Ranged and Technical weapons.

BRAIN
-----

    Brain is a measure of your character's mental processing power, memory,
    perception, and precise, methodical movements like lock-picking and
    stitching up wounds. A character with a high Brain Core are highly skilled,
    hold a wealth of knowledge and typically possess the ability to Weave Silk.

HEART
-----

    Heart is a measure of your character's charisma, will, instinct, emotion,
    and confidence. Your ability to resist and impose mental effects, ignore
    exhaustion and tolerate pain is determined by your Heart Core.


ASPECTS & STRESS
===================

Every Core corresponds with a score between -5 and +5. Each Score is set to 0 by
default. Don't lose sight of the fact that a score in 0 in a Core is not bad by
any means. In The Silk, millennia of technological enhancement has led to the
'average' body clocking in at around the same level as peak performers in modern
times. Even people with desk jobs and 'bad' diets are able to break out a 9.8
second 100m sprint after work. Even the youngest dishwasher has the sharpness of
our PhD candidates.

In societies like this, it's been found that exceptionalism requires intense
sacrifice. Sometimes it's an arm and a leg, sometimes its parts of your soul.
Every advantage you gain is a disadvantage somewhere else. 

As stated, each Core is set at 0, but you may subtract 1 point from a Core in
order to gain a Slant. A Slant represents a choice that makes your Character
better at certain tasks, and worse at others. There's a calculus involved with
trading specialization for general utility when deciding how to use Slants, but
you won't ever end up being amazing at everything.

You can exchange the Slant for one of the following things:

+1 Core Points

    Core Points can be applied to a Core to add a permanent +1 bonus to that
    Core. It can raise a Core to as high at +5. A Core starts to Glow when it
    hits +5, and everything you do with a Glowing Core is done with a Bang. A
    Core can be Supercharged if you give it 5 additional Core Points after
    raising it to +5. If a Core is Supercharged, you gain a significant,
    beneficial status condition that puts you a few steps ahead of Creatures
    without a Supercharged Core. These status conditions are outlined deeper in
    this document under Stress and Injury.

    Be careful, because if a Core is set to a score of -5, that Core gets
    Dimmed. If it's Dimmed, you automatically Bust while using it. Even worse,
    if a Core is set to a score of -5, then knocked again for -5 points, it gets
    Broken. Broken Cores are bad, because they inflinct some nasty status
    conditions. There are listed deeper in this document under "Stress and
    Injury".
 
+5 Splice Points

    Splice Points are used to purchase Mutations. Mutations are special
    abilities that are unique to your Character. They're also where you get a
    chance to add some Aesthetic to your Creature. Be careful, because while
    those floating warbanners with neon sigils might be *great* for a
    knife-fight, they are the last thing you want around when sneaking into a
    databank.

    These Aesthetic changes always correspond to some actual mechanical benefit
    as provided by Splice Points. You're essentially creating your own unique
    hand-crafted abilities and figuring out how that shapes your Avatar.

    Most of the time your Archetype will come with some pre-fitted,
    battle-tested Mutations, but you'll more than likely have to eventually take
    on more Splice Points as you accrue Injuries and Grudges.

+10 Silk Points

    Humans Wove Silk accross the cosmos over the past 50 millenia. The Silk is a
    vast patchwork cloud of nanabots that permeate almost all of human
    civilization.  Typically, you need to be granted access more or less
    directly from BEN, but sometimes people catch the Hum.

    Most can't explain it, but those that can try report some sort of sensory
    effect. Some say it feels like a constant vibration that wavers like fire,
    other say it smells like a constant air of cinnamon, some say they feel like
    they're wrapped in pink velvet. 

    For a variety of reasons, people start feel the Hum and can start to shape
    the Silk without the consent of the parties that normally control it. It's
    complicated, intricate stuff that let Silk Weavers do some truly scary
    stuff. Silk Weavers crack 500ft long bolts of lightning across the field,
    and erect pillars of fire that quells entire riots. It's error prone though,
    and one stray blaster shot or one too-close explosion when you're Weaving
    something big things get *real* messy for the Weaver and their friends.
